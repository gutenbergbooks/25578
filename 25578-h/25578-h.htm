<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>AUNT SOPHRONIA</h3>


<p><span class='smcap'>The</span> Reverend Thomas Wilson's sister, Miss
Sophronia, had come to Sunbridge on a Tuesday
evening late in June to make her brother's family
a long-promised visit. But it was not until the next
morning that she heard something that sent her to
her sister-in-law in a burst of astonishment almost
too great for words.</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, Mary, what is this I hear?"
she demanded. "Edith insists that her cousin,
Cordelia, is going to Texas next week&mdash;to Texas!&mdash;<i>Cordelia!</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is, Sophronia," replied the minister's
wife, trying to make her answer sound as cheerful
and commonplace as she could, and as if Texas were
in the next room. (It was something of a trial to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Mrs. Thomas Wilson that her husband's sister
could not seem to understand that she, a minister's
wife for eighteen years and the mother of five children,
ought to know what was proper and right for
her orphaned niece to do&mdash;at least fully as much
as should a spinster, who had never brought up
anything but four cats and a parrot!) "Edith is
quite right. Cordelia is going to Texas next week."</p>

<p>"But, Mary, are you crazy? To let a child like
that go all the way from here to Texas&mdash;one
would think New Hampshire and Texas were
twenty miles apart!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson sighed a little wearily.</p>

<p>"Cordelia isn't exactly a child, Sophronia, you
must remember that. She was sixteen last November;
and she's very self-reliant and capable for her
age, too. Besides, she isn't going alone, you know."</p>

<p>"Alone!" exclaimed Miss Sophronia. "Mary,
surely, the rest that Edith said isn't true! Those
other girls aren't going, too, are they?&mdash;Elsie
Martin, and that flyaway Tilly Mack, and all?"</p>

<p>"I think they are, Sophronia."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the crazy things anybody ever
heard of!" almost groaned the lady. "Mary, what
<i>are</i> you thinking of?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking of Cordelia," returned the minister's
wife, with a spirit that was as sudden as it was
unusual. "Sophronia, for twelve years, ever since
she came to me, Cordelia has been just a Big Sister<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in the family; and she's had to fetch and carry and
trot and run her little legs off for one after another
of the children, as well as for her uncle and me.
You <i>know</i> how good she is, and how conscientious.
You know how anxious she always is to do exactly
right. She's never had a playday, and I'm sure she
deserves one if ever a girl did! Vacations to her
have never meant anything but more care and more
time for housework."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson paused for breath, then went on
with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>"When this chance came up, Tom and I thought
at first, of course, just as you did, that it was quite
out of the question; but&mdash;well, we decided to let
her go. And I haven't been sorry a minute since.
She's Tom's only brother's child, but we've never
been able to do much for her, as you know. We
can let her have this chance, though. And she's so
happy&mdash;dear child!"</p>

<p>"But what is it? How did it happen? Who's
going? Edith's story sounded so absurd to me I
could make precious little out of it. She insisted
that the 'Happy X's' were going."</p>

<p>The minister's wife smiled.</p>

<p>"It's the girls' 'Hexagon Club,' Sophronia.
They call themselves the 'Happy Hexagons.' There
are six of them."</p>

<p>"Humph!" commented Miss Sophronia. "Who
are they&mdash;besides Cordelia?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bertha Brown, Tilly Mack, Alma Lane, Elsie
Martin, and Genevieve Hartley."</p>

<p>"And <i>who?</i>" frowned Miss Sophronia at the
last name.</p>

<p>"Genevieve Hartley. She is the little Texas girl.
It is to her ranch they are going."</p>

<p>"<i>Her</i> ranch!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;her father's."</p>

<p>"But who is she? What's she doing here?"</p>

<p>"She's been going to school this winter. She's
at the Kennedys'."</p>

<p>"A Texas ranch-girl at the Kennedys'! Why,
they're <i>nice</i> people!" exclaimed Miss Sophronia,
opening wide her eyes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson laughed now outright.</p>

<p>"You'd better not let Miss Genevieve hear you
say 'nice' in that tone of voice&mdash;and in just that
connection, Sophronia," she warned her. "Genevieve
might think you meant to insinuate that there
weren't any <i>nice</i> people in Texas&mdash;and she's very
fond of Texas!"</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mean that, of course. Still, a
ranch must be sort of wild and&mdash;and mustangy,
seems to me; and I was thinking of the
Kennedys, especially Miss Jane Chick. Imagine
saying 'wild' and 'Miss Jane' in the same
breath!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," smiled Mrs. Wilson; "and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
guess Genevieve has been something of a trial&mdash;in
a way; though they love her dearly&mdash;both of them.
She's a very lovable girl. But she <i>is</i> heedless and
thoughtless; and, of course, she wasn't at all used
to our ways here in the East. Her mother died
when she was eight years old; since then she has
been brought up by her father on the ranch. She
blew into Sunbridge last August like a veritable
breeze from her own prairies&mdash;and the Kennedy
home isn't used to breezes&mdash;especially Miss Jane.
I imagine Genevieve did stir things up a little there
all winter&mdash;though she has improved a great deal
since she came."</p>

<p>"But why did she come in the first place?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson smiled oddly.</p>

<p>"That's the best part of it," she said. "It seems
that last April, when Mrs. Kennedy and Miss Chick
were on their way home from California, they
stopped in Houston, Texas, a few days, and there
they met John Hartley and his daughter, Genevieve.
It appears they had known him years ago when they
were 'the Chick girls,' and he came to Sunbridge
to visit relatives. I've heard it whispered that he
was actually a bit in love with one of them, though
I never heard whether it was Miss Jane, or the one
who is now the Widow Kennedy. However that
may be, he was delighted to see them in Texas,
report says, and to introduce to them his daughter,
Genevieve."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"But that doesn't explain how the girl came
here," frowned Miss Sophronia.</p>

<p>"No, but I will," smiled her sister-in-law.
"Fond and proud as Mr. Hartley very plainly was
of his daughter, it did not take Mrs. Kennedy long
to see that he was very much disturbed at the sort
of life she was living at the ranch. That is, he felt
that the time had come now when she needed something
that only school, young girl friends, and
gently-bred women could give her; yet he could
not bear the thought of sending her off alone to an
ordinary boarding school. Then is when Mrs.
Kennedy arose to the occasion; and very quickly
it was settled that Genevieve should come here to
her in Sunbridge for school this last winter&mdash;which
she did, and Mrs. Kennedy has been a veritable
mother to her ever since. She calls her 'Aunt
Julia.'"</p>

<p>"Hm-m; very fine, I'm sure," murmured Miss
Sophronia, a little shortly. "And now she's asked
these girls home with her&mdash;the whole lot of them!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and they're crazy over it&mdash;as you'd
know they would be."</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia sniffed audibly.</p>

<p>"Humph! It's the parents that are crazy, I'm
thinking," she corrected. "Imagine it&mdash;six scatter-brained
children, and all the way to Texas!
Mary!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but the father is in the East here, on business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and he goes back with them," conciliated Mrs.
Wilson, hastily. "Besides, Mrs. Kennedy is going,
too."</p>

<p>Miss Sophronia raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say I envy her the thing she's
undertaken. Imagine <i>my</i> attempting to chaperon
six crazy girls all the way from New Hampshire to
Texas&mdash;and then on a ranch for nobody knows
how long after that!"</p>

<p>"I can't imagine&mdash;<i>your</i> doing it, Sophronia,"
rejoined the minister's wife, demurely. And at the
meaning emphasis and the twinkle in her eye, Miss
Sophronia sniffed again audibly.</p>

<p>"When do they go?" she asked in her stiffest
manner.</p>

<p>"The first day of July."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Very fine, I'm sure. Still&mdash;I've been
thinking of the expense. Of course, for a minister&mdash;"</p>


<p>Mrs. Wilson bit her lip. After a moment she
filled the pause that her sister-in-law had left.</p>

<p>"I understand, of course, what you mean, Sophronia,"
she acknowledged. "And ministers'
families don't have much money for Texas trips,
I'll own. As it happens, however, the trip will cost
the young people nothing. Mr. Hartley very kindly
bears all the expenses."</p>

<p>"He does?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He declares he shall be in the girls' debt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
even then. You see, last winter Genevieve sprained
her ankle, and was shut up for weeks in the house.
It was a very bad sprain, and naturally it came
pretty hard on such an active, outdoor girl as she
is. Mrs. Kennedy says she thinks Genevieve and
all the rest of them would have gone wild if it
hadn't been for the girls. One or more of them
was there every day. Then is when they formed
their Hexagon Club. It was worth everything to
Genevieve, as you can imagine; and Mr. Hartley
declares that nothing he can ever do will half repay
them. Besides, he wants Genevieve to be with nice
girls all she can&mdash;she's had so little of girls' society.
So he's asked them to go as his guests."</p>

<p>"Dear me! Well, he must have some money!"</p>

<p>"He has. Mrs. Kennedy says he is a man of independent
means, and he has no one but Genevieve
to spend his money on. So, as for this trip&mdash;in his
whole-hearted, generous Western fashion, he pays
all the bills himself."</p>

<p>"Hm-m; very kind, I'm sure," admitted Miss
Sophronia, grudgingly. "Well, I'm glad, at least,
that it doesn't cost you anything."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, then Mrs. Wilson
said, apologetically:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Sophronia, but I'm afraid you'll have
to stand it till the children go&mdash;and there'll be
something to stand, too; for it's 'Texas, Texas,
Texas,' from morning till night, everywhere. Genevieve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
herself is in New Jersey visiting friends, but
that doesn't seem to make any difference. The
whole town is wildly excited over the trip. I found
even little Mrs. Miller, the dressmaker, yesterday
poring over an old atlas spread out on her cutting-table.</p>

<p>"'I was just a-lookin' up where Texas was,' she
explained when she saw me. 'My! only think of
havin' folks go all that distance&mdash;folks I know, I
mean. I'm sure I'd never dare to go&mdash;or let my
girl.'"</p>

<p>"Very sensible woman, I'm sure," remarked Miss
Sophronia.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson smiled; but she went on imperturbably.</p>

<p>"Even the little tots haven't escaped infection.
Imagine my sensations Sunday when Bettie Barker,
the primmest Miss Propriety in my infant class,
asked: 'Please, Mis' Wilson, what is a broncho, and
how do you bust 'em?'"</p>

<p>This, indeed, was too much for even Miss Sophronia's
gravity. Her lips twitched and relaxed
in a broad smile.</p>

<p>"Well, upon my word!" she ejaculated, as she
rose to her feet to go up-stairs to her room. "Upon
my word!"</p>

<p>An hour later, in that same room, Mrs. Wilson,
going in to place some fresh towels upon the rack,
found a huge book spread open on Miss Sophronia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
bed. The book was number seven in the Reverend
Thomas Wilson's most comprehensive encyclopedia;
and it was open at the word "Texas."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson smiled and went out, closing the
door softly behind her.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, as Mrs. Wilson had said, "Texas,
Texas, Texas," everywhere throughout the town.
Old atlases were brought down from attics, and old
geographies were dug out of trunks. Even the dictionaries
showed smudges in the T's where not over-clean
fingers had turned hurried pages for possible
information. The library was besieged at all hours,
particularly by the Happy Hexagons, for they, of
course, were the storm-center of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Ordinarily the club met but once a week; now
they met daily&mdash;even in the absence of their beloved
president, Genevieve. Heretofore they had
met usually in the parsonage; now they met in the
grove back of the schoolhouse.</p>

<p>"It seems more appropriate, somehow," Elsie
had declared; "more sort of airy and&mdash;Texasy!"</p>

<p>"Yes; and we want to get used to space&mdash;wide,
wide space! Genevieve says it's all space," Bertha
Brown had answered, with a far-reaching fling of
her arms.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Bertha! Just be sure you've got the
space, then, before you get used to it," retorted Tilly,
aggrievedly, straightening her hat which had been
knocked awry by one of the wide-flung arms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>The Happy Hexagons met, of course, to study
Texas, and to talk Texas; though, as Bertha
Brown's brother, Charlie, somewhat impertinently
declared, they did not need to meet to <i>talk</i> Texas&mdash;they
did that without any meeting! All of which
merely meant, of course, retaliated the girls, that
Charlie was jealous because he also could not go to
Texas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PLANS FOR TEXAS</h3>


<p>It was a pretty little grove in which the Happy
Hexagons met to study and to talk Texas. Nor
were they the only ones that met there. Though
Harold Day, Alma Lane's cousin, was not to be of
the Texas party, the girls invited him to meet with
them, as he was Texas-born, and was one of Genevieve's
first friends in Sunbridge. On the outskirts
of the magic circle, sundry smaller brothers and
sisters and cousins of the members hung adoringly.
Even grown men and women came sometimes, and
stood apart, looking on with what the Happy Hexagons
chose to think were admiring, awestruck eyes&mdash;which
was not a little flattering, though quite
natural and proper, decided the club. For, of course,
not every one could go to Texas, to be sure!</p>

<p>At the beginning, at least, of each meeting, affairs
were conducted with the seriousness due to so important
a subject. In impressive silence the club
seated itself in a circle; and solemnly Cordelia Wilson,
the treasurer, opened the meeting, being (according
to Tilly) a "perfect image of her uncle in
the pulpit."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fellow members, once more we find ourselves
gathered together for the purpose of the study of
Texas," she would begin invariably. And then perhaps:
"We will listen to Miss Bertha Brown, please.
Miss Brown, what new thing&mdash;I mean, what new
features have you discovered about Texas?"</p>

<p>If Miss Brown had something to say&mdash;and of
course she did have something (she would have been
disgraced, otherwise)&mdash;she said it. Then each in
turn was asked, after which the discussion was open
to all.</p>

<p>They were lively meetings. No wonder small
brothers and sisters and cousins hung entranced on
every word. No wonder, too, that at last, one day,
quite carried away with the enthusiasm of the moment,
they made so bold as to have something to say
on their own account. It happened like this:</p>

<p>"Texas is the largest state in the Union," announced
Bertha Brown, who had been called on first.
"It has an area about one twelfth as large as that
of the whole United States. If all the population of
the country were placed there, the state would not be
as thickly settled as the eastern shore of Massachusetts
is. Six different flags have waved over it since
its discovery two hundred years ago: France, Spain,
Mexico, Republic of Texas, Confederate States of
America, and the Star Spangled Banner."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I said most of that two days ago," muttered
Tilly, not under breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it," pouted Bertha; "there
isn't very much new left to say, Tilly Mack, and you
know it. Besides, I didn't have a minute's time this
morning to look up a single thing."</p>

<p>"Order&mdash;order in the court," rapped Cordelia,
sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it doesn't matter a bit if we do say the
same things," protested Alma Lane, quickly. (Alma
was always trying to make peace between combatants.)
"I'm sure we shall remember it all the
better if we do repeat it."</p>

<p>"Of course we shall," agreed Cordelia, promptly.
"Now, Alma&mdash;I mean Miss Lane&mdash;" (this
title-giving was brand-new, having been introduced
as a special mark of dignity fitting to the occasion;
and it was not easy to remember!)&mdash;"perhaps you
will tell us what you have found out."</p>

<p>"Well, the climate is healthful," began Alma,
hopefully. "Texas is less subject to malarial diseases
than any of the other states on the Gulf of
Mexico. September is the most rainy month; December
the least. The mean annual temperature
near the mouth of the Rio Grande is 72&deg;; while
along the Red River the mean annual temperature
is only 80&deg;. In the northwestern part of the state
the mean annual&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alma, please," begged Tilly, in mock horror,
raising both her hands, "<i>please</i> don't give us any
more of those mean annual temperatures. I'm sure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
if they can be any <i>meaner</i> than the temperature right
here to-day is," she sighed, as she fell to fanning
herself vigorously, "I don't want to know what it
is!"</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Cordelia, in shocked disapproval.
"What would Genevieve say!"</p>

<p>Tilly shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Say? She wouldn't say anything&mdash;she
couldn't," declared Tilly, unexpectedly, "because
she'd be laughing at us so for digging into Texas
like this and unearthing all its poor little secrets!"</p>

<p>"But, Tilly, I think we ought to study it," reproved
Cordelia, majestically, above the laugh that
followed Tilly's speech. "Elsie&mdash;I mean, Miss
Martin,&mdash;what did you find out to-day?"</p>

<p>Elsie wrinkled her nose in a laughing grimace at
Tilly, then began to speak in an exaggeratedly solemn
tone of voice.</p>

<p>"I find Texas is so large, and contains so great a
variety of soil, and climate, that any product of the
United States can be grown within its limits. It is
a leader on cotton. Corn, wheat, rice, peanuts,
sugar cane and potatoes are also grown, besides
tobacco."</p>

<p>"And watermelons, Elsie," cut in Bertha Brown.
"I found in a paper that just last year Texas grew
140,000,000 watermelons."</p>

<p>"I was coming to the watermelons," observed
Elsie, with dignity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wish I were&mdash;I dote on watermelons!"
pouted Tilly in an audible aside that brought a
chuckle of appreciation from Harold Day.</p>

<p>Cordelia gave her a reproachful look. Elsie
went on, her chin a little higher.</p>

<p>"Texas is the greatest producer of honey in the
United States. As for the cattle&mdash;prior to 1775
there were vast ranches all over Southwestern Texas,
and herds of hundreds of wild cattle were gathered
and driven to New Orleans. I found some figures
that told the number of animals in 1892, or about
then. I'll give them. They're old now, of course,
but they'll do to show what a lot of animals there
were there then."</p>

<p>Elsie paused to take breath, but for only a moment.</p>

<p>"There were 7,500,000 head of cattle, 5,000,000
sheep, and 1,210,000 horses, besides more than
2,321,000 hogs."</p>

<p>There was a sudden giggle from Tilly&mdash;an explosive
giggle that brought every amazed eye upon
her.</p>

<p>"Well, really, Tilly," disapproved Elsie, aggrievedly,
"I'm sure I don't see <i>what</i> there was so
very funny in that!"</p>

<p>"There wasn't," choked Tilly; "only I was
thinking, what an awful noise it would be if all
those 2,321,000 hogs got under the gate at once."</p>

<p>"Tilly!" scolded Cordelia; but she laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not help it. They all laughed. Even the
little boys and girls on the outskirts giggled shrilly,
and stole the opportunity to draw nearer to the
magic circle. Almost at once, however, Cordelia
regained her dignity.</p>

<p>"Miss Mack, we'll hear from you, please&mdash;seriously,
I mean. You haven't told us yet what you've
found."</p>

<p>Tilly flushed a little.</p>

<p>"I didn't find anything."</p>

<p>"Why, Tilly Mack!" cried a chorus of condemning
voices.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't," defended Tilly. "In the first
place I've told everything I can think of: trees,
fruits, history, and everything; and this morning
I just had to go to Mrs. Miller's for a fitting."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tilly, <i>another</i> new dress?" demanded Elsie
Martin, her voice a pathetic wail of wistfulness.</p>

<p>"But there are still so many things," argued Cordelia,
her grave eyes fixed on Tilly, "so many things
to learn that&mdash;" She was interrupted by an eager
little voice from the outskirts.</p>

<p>"I've got something, please, Cordelia. Mayn't
I tell it? It's a brand-newest thing. Nobody's said
it once!"</p>

<p>Cordelia turned to confront her ten-year-old
cousin, Edith.</p>

<p>"Why, Edith!"</p>

<p>"And I have, too," piped up Edith's brother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Fred, with shrill earnestness. (Fred was eight.)
"And mine's new, too."</p>

<p>Cordelia frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"But, children, you don't belong to the club.
Only members can talk, you know."</p>

<p>"Pooh! let's hear it, Cordelia," shrugged Tilly.
"I'm sure if it's <i>new</i>, we need it&mdash;of all the old
chestnuts we've heard to-day!"</p>

<p>"Well," agreed Cordelia, "what is it, Edith?
You spoke first."</p>

<p>"It's gypsies," announced the small girl, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Gypsies!" chorused the Happy Hexagons in
open unbelief.</p>

<p>"Yes. There's lots of 'em there&mdash;more than
'most anywhere else in the world."</p>

<p>The girls looked at each other with puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, I never heard Genevieve say anything
about gypsies," ventured Tilly.</p>

<p>"Well, they're there, anyhow," maintained Edith;
"I read it."</p>

<p>"You read it! Where?" demanded Cordelia.</p>

<p>"In father's big sac'l'pedia." Edith's voice
sounded grieved, but triumphant. "I was up in
auntie's room, and I saw it. It was open on her
bed, and I read it. It said there was coal and iron
and silver, and lots and lots of gypsies."</p>

<p>There was a breathless hush, followed suddenly
by a shrieking laugh from Tilly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, girls, girls!" she gasped. "That blessed
child means 'gypsum.' I saw that in papa's encyclopedia
just the other day."</p>

<p>"But what is gypsum?" demanded Alma Lane.</p>

<p>"Mercy! don't ask me," shuddered Tilly. "I
looked it up in the dictionary, but it only said it was
a whole lot of worse names. All I could make out
was that it had crystals, and was used for dressing
for soils, and for plaster of Paris. <i>Gypsies!</i> Oh,
Edith, Edith, what a circus you are!" she chuckled,
going into another gale of laughter.</p>

<p>It was Fred's injured tones that filled the first
pause in the general hubbub that followed Tilly's
explanation.</p>

<p>"You haven't heard mine, yet," he challenged.
"Mine's right!"</p>

<p>"Well?" questioned Cordelia, wiping her eyes.
(Even Cordelia had laughed till she cried.) "What
is yours, Fred?"</p>

<p>"It's boats. There hasn't one of you said a single
thing about the boats you were going to ride in."</p>

<p>"Boats!" cried the girls in a second chorus of
unbelief.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't try to talk me out of that,"
bristled the boy. "I <i>know</i> what <i>I'm</i> talking about.
Old Mr. Hodges told me himself. He's been in 'em.
He said that years and years ago, when he was a
little boy like me, he and his father and mother
went 'way across the state of Texas in a prairie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
schooner; and I asked father that night what a
schooner was, and he said it was a boat. Well, he
did!" maintained Fred, a little angrily, as a shout
of laughter rose from the girls.</p>

<p>"And so 'tis a boat&mdash;some kinds of schooners,"
Harold Day soothed the boy quickly, rising to his
feet, and putting a friendly arm about the small
heaving shoulders. "Come on, son, let's you and
I go over to the house. I've got a dandy picture of
a prairie schooner over there, and we'll hunt it up
and see just what it looks like." And with a ceremonious
"Good day, ladies!" and an elaborate
flourish of his hat toward the Happy Hexagons,
Harold drew the boy more closely into the circle
of his arm and turned away.</p>

<p>It was the signal for a general breaking up of the
club meeting. Cordelia, only, looked a little anxiously
after the two boys, as she complained:</p>

<p>"Harold never tells a thing that he knows about
Texas, and he must know a lot of things, even if
he did leave there when he was a tiny little baby!"</p>

<p>"Don't you fret, Cordy," retorted Tilly. (Cordelia
did not like to be called "Cordy," and Tilly
knew it.) "Harold Day will talk Texas all right
after Genevieve gets back. Besides, you couldn't
expect a boy to join in with a girls' club like us,
just as if he were another girl&mdash;specially as he
isn't going to Texas, anyway."</p>

<p>"Well, all he ever does is just to sit and look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
bored&mdash;except when Tilly gets in some of her
digs," chuckled Bertha.</p>

<p>"Glad I'm good for something, if nothing but to
stir up Harold, then," laughed Tilly, as she turned
away to answer Elsie Martin's anxious: "Tilly,
what color is the new dress? Is it red?"</p>

<p>It was the next day that the letter came from
Genevieve. Cordelia brought it to the club meeting
that afternoon; and so full of importance and excitement
was she that for once she quite forgot to
open the meeting with her usual ceremony.</p>

<p>"Girls, girls, just listen to this!" she began
breathlessly.</p>

<p>The Happy Hexagons opened wide their eyes.
Never before had they seen the usually placid Cordelia
like this.</p>

<p>"Why, Cordelia, you're almost girlish!" observed
Tilly, cheerfully.</p>

<p>Cordelia did not seem even to hear this gibe.</p>

<p>"It's a letter from Genevieve," she panted, as she
hurriedly spread open the sheet of note paper in her
hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dear Cordelia, and the whole Club," read Cordelia,
excitedly. "I came up yesterday from New
Jersey with the Hardings for two days in New
York. I have been to see the animals at the Zoo
all the afternoon, and I'm going to see the Hippodrome
this evening. That sounds like another animal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
but it isn't one, they say. It's a place all lights
and music and crowds, and with a stage 'most as
big as Texas itself, with scores of real horses and
cowboys riding all over it.</p>

<p>"I am having a perfectly beautiful time, but I
just can't wait to see my own beloved home on the
big prairie, and have you all there with me. I
sha'n't see it quite so soon though, for father has
been delayed about some of his business, and he
can't come for me quite so soon as he expected. He
says we sha'n't get away from Sunbridge until the
fifth; but he's engaged five sections in a sleeper
leaving Boston at eight <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> So we'll go then sure.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Harding is calling me. Good-by till I see
you. We're coming the third. With heaps of love
to everybody, Your own</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Genevieve Hartley.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>"Well, I like that," bridled Tilly. "Just think&mdash;not
go until the fifth!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but just think of going at all," comforted
Alma Lane, hurriedly; "and in sleepers, too!
Sleepers are loads of fun. I rode in one fifty miles,
once&mdash;it wasn't in the night, though."</p>

<p>"I rode in one at night!" Tilly's voice rose
dominant, triumphant.</p>

<p>"My stars!"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Where?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"What was it like?"</p>

<p>"Was it fun?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us?"</p>

<p>Tilly laughed in keen enjoyment of the commotion
she had created.</p>

<p>"Don't you wish you knew?" she teased. "Just
you wait and see!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but, Tilly, do they lay you down on a little
narrow shelf, really?" worried Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't take off a single thing, anyhow," announced
Bertha, with decision, "not even my shoes.
I'm just sure there'll be an accident!"</p>

<p>Tilly laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"A fine traveler you'll make, Bertha," she
scoffed. "Sleepers are made to sleep in, young
lady&mdash;not to lie awake and worry in, for fear
there'll be an accident and you'll lose your shoes.
As for you, Cordy, and the shelf you're fretting
over&mdash;there are shelves, in a way; but you lay
yourself down on them, my child. Nobody else
does it for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Cordelia, a little stiffly.
Cordelia did not like to be called "my child"&mdash;specially
by Tilly, who was not quite sixteen, and
who was the youngest member of the club.</p>

<p>"But, Tilly, are&mdash;are sleepers nice, daytimes?"
asked Edith Wilson, who, as usual, was hovering
near. "I should think they'd be lovely for nights&mdash;but
I wouldn't like to have to lie down all day!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Tilly laughed so hard at this that Edith grew red
of face indeed before Alma patched matters up and
made peace.</p>

<p>It was the trip to Texas that was the all-absorbing
topic of discussion that day; and it was the
trip to Texas that Cordelia Wilson was thinking of
as she walked slowly home that night after leaving
the girls at the corner.</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;" she began just under her breath;
then stopped short. An old man, known as "Uncle
Bill Hodges," stood directly in her path.</p>

<p>"Miss Cordelia, I&mdash;I want to speak to ye, just a
minute," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." Cordelia smiled politely.</p>

<p>The old man threw a suspicious glance over his
shoulder, then came a step nearer.</p>

<p>"I ain't tellin' this everywhere, Miss Cordelia,
and I don't want you to say nothin'. You're goin'
to Texas, they tell me."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Hodges, I am." Cordelia tried to
make her voice sound properly humble, but pride
would vibrate through it.</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;" The man hesitated, looked around
again suspiciously, then blurted out a storm of
words with the rush of desperation. "I&mdash;years
ago, Miss Cordelia, I let a man in Boston have a lot
of money. He said 'twas goin' into an oil well out
in Texas, and that when it came back there'd be a
lot more with it a-comin' to me. So I let him have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
it. I liked Texas, anyhow&mdash;I'd been there as a
boy."</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded Cordelia, smiling as she remembered
the prairie schooner that was Fred's "boat."</p>

<p>"Well, for a while I did get money&mdash;dividends,
he called 'em. Then it all stopped off short. They
shut the man up in prison, and closed the office.
And there's all my money! They do be sayin', too,
that there ain't no such place as this oil well there&mdash;that
is, not the way he said it was&mdash;so big and fine
and promisin'. Well, now, of course I can't go to
see, Miss Cordelia&mdash;an old man like me, all the
way to Texas. But you are goin'. So I thought I'd
just ask you to look around a little if you happened
to hear anything about this well. Maybe you could
go and see it, and then tell me. I've written down
the name on this paper," finished the man, thrusting
his trembling fingers into his pocket, and bringing
out a small piece of not over-clean paper.</p>

<p>"Why, of&mdash;of course, Mr. Hodges," promised
Cordelia, doubtfully, as she took the paper. "I'd
love to do anything I could for you&mdash;anything!
Only I'm afraid I don't know much about oil wells,
you see. Do they look just like&mdash;water wells, with
a pump or a bucket? Bertha's aunt has one of those
on her farm."</p>

<p>"I don't know, child, I don't know," murmured
the old man, shaking his head sadly, as he turned
away. "Sometimes I think there ain't any such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
things, anyhow. But you'll do your best, I know.
I can trust <i>you!</i>"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," returned Cordelia, earnestly,
slipping the bit of paper into the envelope of Genevieve's
letter in her hand.</p>

<p>In her own room that night Cordelia Wilson got
out her list marked "Things to do in Texas," and
studied it with troubled eyes. She had now one
more item to add to it&mdash;and it was already so long!</p>

<p>She had started the list for her own benefit.
Then had come the request from queer old Hermit
Joe to be on the lookout for his son who had gone
years ago to Texas. After that, commissions for
others followed rapidly. So many people had so
many things they wanted her to do in Texas!&mdash;and
nobody wanted them talked about in Sunbridge.</p>

<p>Slowly, with careful precision, she wrote down
this last one. Then, a little dubiously, she read
over the list.</p>

Find out if it really is shaped like a bonnet.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Now if I can just fix all those people's names
in my mind," mused Cordelia, aloud; "and seems
as if I might&mdash;there are only four. John Sanborn,
Lizzie Higgins, Lester Goodwin, and James Hunt,"
she chanted over and over again. She was still
droning the same refrain when she fell asleep that
night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>THE COMING OF GENEVIEVE</h3>


<p>Genevieve was to arrive in Sunbridge at three
o'clock on the afternoon of the third of July. Her
father was to remain in Boston until one of the
evening trains. The Happy Hexagons, knowing
Genevieve's plans, decided to give her a welcome befitting
the club and the occasion. They invited
Harold Day, of course, to join them.</p>

<p>Harold laughed good-humoredly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be there all right, at the station," he
assured them. "I've got Mrs. Kennedy's permission
to bring her up to the house; but I don't think
I'll join in on your show. I'll let you girls do that."</p>

<p>The girls pouted a little, but they were too excited
to remain long out of humor.</p>

<p>"Don't our dresses look pretty! I know Genevieve'll
be pleased," sighed Elsie Martin, as, long
before the train was due that afternoon, the girls
arrived at the station.</p>

<p>"Of course she'll be pleased," cried Alma Lane.
"She can't help it. I can hear her laugh and clap
her hands now, when she sees us&mdash;and hears us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"So can I," echoed Bertha. "And how her
eyes will dance! I love to see Genevieve's eyes
dance."</p>

<p>"So do I," chorused the others, fervently.</p>

<p>Sunbridge was a quiet little town in southern
New Hampshire near the state line. It had wide,
tree-shaded streets, and green-shuttered white
houses set far back in spacious lawns. The station
at this hour was even quieter than the town, and
there were few curious eyes to question the meaning
of the unusual appearance of five laughing, excited
young girls, all dressed alike, and all showing
flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>At one minute before three o'clock, a tall, good-looking
youth drove up in a smart trap, and was
hailed with shouts of mingled joy and relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harold, we were just sure you were going
to be late," cried Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Late? Not I&mdash;to-day!" laughed the boy.
Then, with genuine admiration: "Say, that is
pretty slick, girls. I'll take off my hat to the Happy
Hexagons to-day all right!" he finished, with an
elaborate flourish.</p>

<p>"Thank you," twittered Tilly, saucily. "Now
don't you wish you had joined us? But then&mdash;<i>you</i>
couldn't have worn a white frock!"</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/gs02.jpg" width="322" height="400" alt="&quot;A TALL, SLENDER GIRL ... APPEARED AT A CAR DOOR&quot;" title="&quot;A TALL, SLENDER GIRL ... APPEARED AT A CAR DOOR&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;A TALL, SLENDER GIRL .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. APPEARED AT A CAR DOOR&quot;</span>
</div>
<p>A prolonged bell-clanging and the rumble of an
approaching train prevented Harold's reply, and
sent the girls into a flutter of excitement. A moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
later they stood in line, waiting, breathless
with suspense.</p>

<p>They made a wonderfully pretty picture. Each
girl was in white, even to her shoes and stockings.
Around each waist was a sash of a handsome shade
of blue. The same color showed at the throat and
on the hair.</p>

<p>Quietly they watched the train roll into the station,
and still quietly they stood until a tall, slender
girl with merry brown eyes and soft fluffy brown
hair appeared at a car door and tripped lightly down
the steps to the platform. They waited only till she
ran toward them; then in gleeful chorus they
chanted:</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"Texas, Texas, Tex&mdash;Tex&mdash;Texas!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Texas, Texas, Rah! Rah! Rah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">GENEVIEVE!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>What happened next was a surprise. Genevieve
did not laugh, nor cry out, nor clap her hands. Her
eyes did not dance. She stopped and fumbled with
the fastening of her suit-case. The next minute the
train drew out of the station, and the girls were left
alone in their corner. Genevieve looked up, at that,
and came swiftly toward them.</p>

<p>They saw then: the brown eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>The girls had intended to repeat their Texas yell;
but with one accord now they cried out in dismay:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Genevieve! Why, Genevieve, you're&mdash;crying!"</p>

<p>"I know I am, and I could shake myself," choked
Genevieve, hugging each girl in turn spasmodically.</p>

<p>"But, Genevieve, what is the matter?" appealed
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I don't know&mdash;and that's what's
the trouble," wailed Genevieve. "I don't know why
I'm crying when I'm so g-glad to see you. But I
reckon 'twas that&mdash;'Texas'!"</p>

<p>"But we thought you'd like that," argued Elsie.</p>

<p>"I did&mdash;I do," stammered Genevieve, incoherently;
"and it made me cry to think I did&mdash;I mean,
to think I do&mdash;so much!"</p>

<p>"Well, we're glad you did, or do, anyhow,"
laughed Harold Day, holding out his hand. "And
we're glad you're back again. I've got Jerry here
and the cart. This your bag?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right here; and thank you, Harold," she
smiled a little mistily. "And girls, you're lovely&mdash;just
lovely; and I don't know why I'm crying. But
you're to come over&mdash;straight over to the house
this very afternoon. I want to hear that 'T-Texas'
again. I want to hear it six times running!" she
finished, as she sprang lightly into the cart.</p>

<p>On the way with Harold, she grew more calm.</p>

<p>"You see, once, last fall, I said I hated Sunbridge,
and that I wouldn't stay," she explained a
little shame-facedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"You said you hated it!" cried Harold. "You
never told me that. Why, I thought you liked it
here."</p>

<p>"I do, now, and I did&mdash;very soon, specially
after I'd met some one I could talk Texas to all I
wanted to&mdash;<i>you</i>, you know! I reckon I never told
you, but you were a regular safety valve for me in
those days."</p>

<p>"Was I?" laughed the lad.</p>

<p>"Yes, even from that first day," nodded Genevieve,
with a half-wistful smile. "Did I ever tell
you the reason, the real reason, why Aunt Julia
called you into the yard that afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Why, no&mdash;not that I know of." Harold's face
showed a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"Well, 'twas this. I'd been here a week, and I
was so homesick and lonesome for father and the
ranch and all. I was threatening to go back. I
declared I'd walk back, if there was no other way.
Poor Aunt Julia! She tried everything. Specially
she tried to have me meet some nice girls, but I just
wouldn't. I said I didn't want any girls that weren't
Texas girls. I didn't want anything that wasn't
Texas. That's what I'd been saying that very day
out under the trees there, when Aunt Julia looked
toward the street, saw you, and called you into the
yard."</p>

<p>"Is <i>that</i> why she introduced me as the boy who
was born in Texas?" laughed Harold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; and you know how I began to talk Texas
right away."</p>

<p>"But I couldn't help much&mdash;I left there when I
was a baby."</p>

<p>"I know, but you'd been there," laughed Genevieve,
"and that helped. Then, through you, I met
your cousin Alma, and the rest was easy, for I always
had you for that safety valve, to talk Texas
to. You see, it was just that I got homesick. All
my life I'd lived on the ranch, and things here were
so different. I didn't like to&mdash;to mind Mrs. Kennedy
and Miss Jane, very well, I suspect. You see,
at the ranch I'd always had my own way, and&mdash;I
liked it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure that's natural," nodded Harold.</p>

<p>"I know; but I wasn't nice about it," returned
the girl, wistfully. "Father said I must do everything&mdash;everything
they said. And I tried to. But
Miss Jane had such heaps of things for me to do,
and such tiresome things, like dusting and practising,
and learning to cook and to sew! And it
all was specially hard when you remember that I
didn't want to come East in the first place. But I
love it here, now; you know I do. Every one has
been so good to me! Aunt Julia is a dear."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;Miss Jane?" queried Harold, eyeing
her a little mischievously.</p>

<p>Genevieve blushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Jane? Well, she's 'most a dear, too&mdash;sometimes.
As for Sunbridge&mdash;I love both the
East and the West now. Don't you see? But, to-day,
coming up from Boston, I got to thinking
about it&mdash;my dear prairie home; and how I had
hated to leave it, and how now I was going back
to it with Aunt Julia and the girls all with me.
And I was so happy, so wonderfully happy, that a
great big something rose within me, and I felt so&mdash;so
queer, as if I could fly, and fly, and <i>fly!</i> And
then, when I saw the girls all dressed alike so
prettily, and heard the 'Texas, Texas, Texas'&mdash;what
did I do? I didn't do anything but cry&mdash;<i>cry</i>,
Harold, just as if I didn't like things. And
the girls were so disappointed, I know they
were!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; I guess you can make them understand&mdash;anyhow,
you have me," said Harold,
trying to speak with a lightness that would hide the
fact that her words had made him, too, feel "queer."
Harold did not enjoy feeling "queer."</p>

<p>A moment later they turned into the broad white
driveway that led up to the Kennedy home.</p>

<p>On the veranda of the fine old house stood a
sweet-faced, motherly-looking woman with tender
eyes and a loving smile. Near her was a taller,
younger woman with eyes almost as interested,
and a smile almost as cordial.</p>

<p>"You dears&mdash;both of you!" cried Genevieve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
running up the steps and into the arms of the two
women.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Harold," smiled Mrs. Kennedy over
Genevieve's bobbing head; "thank you for bringing
our little girl home."</p>

<p>"As if I wasn't glad to do it!" laughed the boy,
gallantly, as he picked up the reins and sprang into
the cart. To the horse he added later, when quite
out of earshot of the ladies: "Jerry, I'm thinking
Genevieve isn't the only one in that house that has
'improved' since last August. It strikes me that
Miss Jane Chick has done a little on her own account.
Did you see that smile? That was a really,
truly smile, Jerry. Not the 'I-suppose-I-must'
kind!"</p>

<p>Genevieve and the two ladies were still on the
veranda when the five white-clad girls turned in at
the broad front walk.</p>

<p>"We came around this way home," announced
Tilly. "You <i>said</i> you wanted us."</p>

<p>"Want you! Well, I reckon I do," cried Genevieve,
springing to her feet. "Come up here this
minute! Now say it&mdash;say it again&mdash;that thing
you did at the station. I want Aunt Julia to hear
it&mdash;and Miss Jane."</p>

<p>The change in Genevieve's voice and manner was
unconscious, but it was very evident. No one noticed
it apparently, however, but Tilly; and she
only puckered her lips into an odd little smile as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
formed in line with the other girls: Tilly was not
without some experience herself with Miss Jane
and her ways.</p>

<p>"Now, one, two, three, ready!" counted Cordelia,
sternly, her face a tragedy of responsibility
lest this final triumph of their labors should be anything
less than the glorious success the occasion demanded.</p>

<p>Once more five eager, girlish countenances faced
squarely front. Once more five fresh young voices
chanted with lusty precision:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Texas, Texas, Tex&mdash;Tex&mdash;Texas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Texas, Texas, Rah! Rah! Rah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">GENEVIEVE!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>It was finished. Cordelia, with the expression of
one from whom the weight of nations has been
lifted, drew a happy sigh, and looked confidently
about for her reward. Almost at once, however,
her face clouded perplexedly.</p>

<p>Genevieve was dancing lightly on her toes and
clapping her hands softly. Mrs. Kennedy was
laughing with her handkerchief to her lips. But
Miss Jane Chick&mdash;Miss Jane Chick was sitting
erect, her eyes plainly horrified, her hands clapped
to her ears.</p>

<p>"Children, children!" she gasped, as soon as
there was a chance for her voice to be heard. "You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
don't mean to say that you did <i>that</i>&mdash;at a public
railroad station!"</p>

<p>Cordelia looked distressed. The other girls bit
their lips and lifted their chins just a little: they
did not like to be called "children."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Chick," stammered Cordelia, "we
didn't think&mdash;that is, we wanted to do something
to welcome Genevieve, and&mdash;and&mdash;" Cordelia
stopped, and swallowed chokingly.</p>

<p>"But to shout like that," protested Miss Chick.
"You&mdash;<i>young ladies!</i>"</p>

<p>The girls bit their lips still harder and lifted their
chins still higher: they were not quite sure whether
they more disliked to be "children" or "young
ladies"&mdash;in that tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Miss Jane," argued Genevieve, "you
know Sunbridge station is just dead, simply dead at
three o'clock in the afternoon. Nobody ever comes
on that train, hardly, and there wasn't a soul around
but that sleepy Mr. Jones and the station men, and
that old Mrs. Palmer. And you know <i>she</i> wouldn't
hear a gun go off right under her nose."</p>

<p>"Genevieve, my dear!" murmured Mrs. Kennedy&mdash;but
her eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p>Cordelia still looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I know, Genevieve," she frowned anxiously,
"but I never thought of it that way&mdash;what others
would think. Maybe we ought not to have done it,
after all. But I'm sure we didn't mean any harm."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Promptly, now, Mrs. Kennedy came to the
rescue.</p>

<p>"Of course you did not, dear child," she said,
smiling into Cordelia's troubled eyes; "and it was
very sweet and lovely of you girls to think of giving
Genevieve such a pretty welcome. Oh, of course,"
she added with a whimsical glance at her sister,
"we shouldn't exactly advise you to make a practice
of welcoming everybody home in that somewhat
startling fashion. That really wouldn't do, you
know. Sunbridge station might not be quite so
dead next time," she finished, meeting Genevieve's
grateful eyes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"That really was dear of you, Aunt Julia," confided
Genevieve some time later, after the girls had
gone, and when she and Mrs. Kennedy were alone
together. (Miss Jane had gone up-stairs.) "Only
think of the pains they took&mdash;to get themselves
up to look so pretty, besides learning to give that yell
so finely. I was so afraid they'd be hurt at what
Miss Jane said! And I wouldn't want them hurt&mdash;after
all that!"</p>

<p>"Of course you wouldn't," smiled Mrs. Kennedy;
"and my sister wouldn't either, dear."</p>

<p>Genevieve stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"I know she wouldn't, Aunt Julia; but&mdash;but
the girls don't know it. They&mdash;they don't understand
Miss Jane."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"And do you&mdash;always?" The question was
gently put, but its meaning was unmistakable.</p>

<p>Genevieve colored.</p>

<p>"Maybe not&mdash;quite always; but&mdash;Miss Jane
is so&mdash;so shockable!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy made a sudden movement. Apparently
she only stooped to pick up a small thread
from the floor, but when she came upright her face
was a deeper red than just that exertion would seem
to occasion.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, have you been to your room since
you came home?" she asked. There were times
when Mrs. Kennedy could change the subject almost
as abruptly as could Genevieve herself.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Julia. You know Nancy carried up
my suit-case, and I've been too busy telling you all
about my visit to think of anything else."</p>

<p>"Oh," smiled Mrs. Kennedy. "I was just wondering."</p>

<p>Genevieve frowned in puzzled questioning.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going up right away, anyhow," she
said. "Mercy! I reckon I'll go up right now," she
added laughingly, springing to her feet as there
came through the open window behind her the
sound of a clock striking half-past five. "I had no
idea it was so late."</p>

<p>Genevieve was not many minutes in her room before
she ceased to wonder at Mrs. Kennedy's questioning;
for in plain sight on her dressing-table<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
she soon found a small white box addressed to Genevieve
Hartley. The box, upon being opened, disclosed
in a white velvet nest a beautiful little chatelaine
watch in dark blue enamel and gold.</p>

<div class='center'>
"To keep Genevieve's time.<br />
With much love from<br />
Jane Chick."<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>read Genevieve on the little card that was with the
watch.</div>

<p>"Oh, oh, oh, how lovely!" breathed the girl,
hovering over the watch in delight. "And to think
what I said!" With a heightened color she turned,
tripped across the room and hurried down the hall
to Miss Jane's door.</p>

<p>"Miss Jane!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>"May I come in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I want to thank you&mdash;oh, I do want to
thank you, but I don't know how." Genevieve's
eyes were misty.</p>

<p>"For the watch? You like it, then?"</p>

<p>"Like it! I just love it; and I never, never saw
such a beauty!"</p>

<p>"I'm glad you like it."</p>

<p>There was a moment's pause. Over by the dressing-table
Miss Jane was carefully smoothing a refractory
lock of hair into place. She looked so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
calm, so self-contained, so&mdash;far away, thought
Genevieve; if it had been Aunt Julia, now!</p>

<p>Suddenly the girl gave a little skipping run and
enveloped the lady in two wide-flung young arms,
thereby ruffling up more than ever the carefully
smoothed lock of hair.</p>

<p>"Miss, Jane, I&mdash;I've just got to hug you, anyway!"</p>

<p>"Why, Genevieve, my dear!" murmured Miss
Jane, a little dazedly.</p>

<p>From the door Genevieve called back incoherently&mdash;the
hug had been as short in duration as it had
been sudden in action:</p>

<p>"I don't think I can be late now, Miss Jane, ever&mdash;with
that lovely thing to keep time for me. And
I wanted you to know&mdash;next year, when I come
back, I'm just sure I shall cook and sew beautifully,
and do my practising and everything, without once
being told. And if I do sprain my ankle I'll be a
perfect angel&mdash;truly I will. And I won't ever keep
folks waiting, either, or&mdash;mercy! there's Nancy's
first ring now, and I'm not one bit ready!" she
broke off, as the musical notes of a Chinese gong
sounded from the hall below. The next moment
Miss Jane was alone with her thoughts&mdash;and with
the lock of hair that she was still trying to smooth.</p>

<p>"Dear child!" smiled the lady. Then she turned
abruptly and hastened from the room, her hair still
unsmoothed. "I'll just tell Nancy to be a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
slow about ringing that second gong," she murmured.</p>

<p>When Genevieve came down-stairs to supper
that night, she brought with her two books: one a
small paper-covered one, the other a larger one
bound in dark red leather.</p>

<p>"Here's the latest 'Pathfinder'&mdash;only I call it
'Path<i>loser</i>,'" she laughed, handing the smaller
book to Miss Jane Chick; "and here is&mdash;well, just
see what is here," she finished impressively, spreading
open the leather-covered book before Mrs.
Kennedy's eyes.</p>

<p>"'Chronicles of the Hexagon Club,'" read Mrs.
Kennedy. "Oh, a journal!" she smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt Julia. Isn't it lovely?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is! Who will keep it?"</p>

<p>"All of us. We are going to take turns. We
shall write a day apiece&mdash;we six Happy Hexagons
of the Hexagon Club."</p>

<p>"Do the girls know about it?" asked Miss Jane.</p>

<p>"Not yet. I just thought of it yesterday when
I saw the book in the store. Father bought it for
the club&mdash;of course <i>my</i> money was gone long ago&mdash;at
such a time as <i>this</i>," she explained with laughing
emphasis. "I'm going to show the book to the
girls to-morrow. Won't they be tickled&mdash;I mean
pleased," corrected Genevieve, throwing a hasty
glance into Miss Jane's smiling eyes.</p>

<p>"I think they will," agreed that lady, pleasantly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls were pleased, indeed, when Genevieve
told of her plan and showed the book the next day.
But even so entrancing a subject as a journal kept
by each in turn could not hold their attention long;
for time was very short now, and in every household
there were a dozen-and-one last things to be
done before the momentous fifth of July. Even the
Fourth, with its fun and its firecrackers had no
charms for the Happy Hexagons. Of so little consequence
did they consider it, indeed, that at last
one small boy quite lost his patience.</p>

<p>"You won't fire my crackers, you won't take me
to the picnic, you won't play ball, you won't do anything,"
he complained to his absorbed sister. "I
shall be just glad when this old Texas thing is
over!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>ON THE WAY</h3>


<p>All the girls' friends came to see them off at the
station that fifth of July.</p>

<p>"Mercy! it would never do to spring our Texas
yell to-day," chuckled Tilly, eyeing the assembled
crowd; "but wouldn't I like to, though!"</p>

<p>"There's nothing dead about Sunbridge now,
sure," laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"I should say not," declared Harold Day, who
had begged the privilege of going to Boston to see
them aboard their train for Washington.</p>

<p>"For you see," he had argued, "it's to my state,
after all, that you are going, so I ought to be allowed
to do the honors at this end of the trip as long as
I can't at the other!"</p>

<p>They were off at last, Mrs. Kennedy, Mr. Hartley,
the six girls, and Harold. But what a scrambling
it was, and what a confusion of chatter,
laughter, "good-byes," and "write soons"!</p>

<p>In Boston there was a thirty-minute wait in the
South Station before their train was due to leave;
but long before the thirty minutes were over, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
usually serene face of Mrs. Kennedy began to look
flushed and worried.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, my dear," she expostulated at last,
"can't you keep those flutterbudget girls somewhere
near together? It will be time, soon, to take our
train, and only Cordelia is in sight. Not even
Harold and your father are here!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed soothingly.</p>

<p>"I know, Aunt Julia; but they'll be here, I'm
sure. There's still lots of time," she added, glancing
proudly at her pretty new watch.</p>

<p>"But where are they all?"</p>

<p>"Tilly and Elsie have gone for some soda water,
and Bertha for a sandwich at the lunch counter.
She said she just couldn't eat a thing before she left
home. Alma Lane has gone to a drug store across
the street. I don't know where father and Harold
are. They went off together, and&mdash;oh, here they
are!" she broke off in relief, as the two wanderers
appeared.</p>

<p>"And now," summoned Mr. Hartley, "we'll be
off to our car! Why, where are the rest of us?"</p>

<p>"Well, they&mdash;they aren't all here," frowned
Genevieve, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>As at Sunbridge, it was a rush and a scramble at
the last. Tilly, Elsie, and Bertha came back, but
Genevieve went to look for Alma Lane; and when
Alma returned without having seen Genevieve,
Harold had to run post-haste for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure, dearie," said Mr. Hartley to his
daughter, laughingly, when at last he had his
charges all in the car, "this is a little worse than
trying to corral a bunch of bronchos!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but we won't be so bad again," promised
the girl, waving her hand to Harold, who stood
alone outside the window, watching them a little
wistfully.</p>

<p>They had a merry time getting settled, and more
than one tired countenance in the car brightened at
sight of the six eager young faces.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get all five sections together,"
frowned Mr. Hartley. "I got three here, but the
other two are down near the end of the car&mdash;you
know the porter showed you. Do you think we can
make them go, some way?" he questioned Mrs.
Kennedy, anxiously. "I planned for you to have
one of the sections down there by yourself, perhaps,
with two of the young ladies in the other. Will
that do?"</p>

<p>"Of course it will&mdash;and finely, too," declared
the lady. "Genevieve, you and I will go down
there and take one of the girls with us&mdash;perhaps
Bertha. That will leave your father for one up
here, Elsie and Alma for another, and Tilly and
Cordelia for the third."</p>

<p>"I knew she'd put you with Cordelia," chuckled
Bertha to Tilly, under cover of their scramble to
pick out their suit-cases from the pile in which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
porter had left them. "And I'm sure you ought to
be," she laughed. "There'll be some hopes then
that you'll be kept in order!"</p>

<p>"Just look to yourself," retorted Tilly, serenely.
"Mrs. Kennedy put <i>you</i> down there near <i>her</i>&mdash;remember
that!"</p>

<p>"I declare, I felt just like an orange," giggled
Elsie, "with all that talk about 'sections.'"</p>

<p>"I don't see where the shelves are," whispered
Cordelia, craning her short little neck to its full
extent.</p>

<p>"You'll see them all right," promised Tilly.
"Just wait till it's dark, then&mdash;'The goblins'll get
ye if ye don't watch out!'" she quoted, with mock
impressiveness.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were ten years old, and playing
house," chirped Alma Lane, as she happily frowned
over just the proper place for her bag.</p>

<p>"I feel as if it were all a dream, and that I shall
wake up right at home," breathed Cordelia.
"Seems as if it just couldn't be true&mdash;that we're
really going to Texas! Oh, Genevieve, we can't
ever thank you and your father enough," she finished,
as Genevieve came up the aisle.</p>

<p>"As if we wanted thanks, after what you've done
for me!" cried Genevieve. "Besides, you girls
can't be half so glad to go as I am to have you!"</p>

<p>Some time later the porter began to make up the
berths.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Tilly nudged Cordelia violently.</p>

<p>"There's shelf number one, Cordy. How do
you think you'll like it?" she asked.</p>

<p>Cordelia was too absorbed even to notice the
hated "Cordy." With wide-eyed, breathless interest
she was watching the porter.</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;it's the most wonderful thing&mdash;I
ever saw," she breathed in an awestruck voice.</p>

<p>It was after the car was quiet that night that
Genevieve, in her upper berth, pulled apart the
heavy curtains and peeped out into the long narrow
aisle between the swaying draperies.</p>

<p>The train was moving very rapidly. The air was
heavy and close. The night was an uncomfortably
warm one. Genevieve had been too excited to sleep.
Even yet it did not seem quite real&mdash;that the Happy
Hexagons were all there with her, and that they
were going to her far-away Texas home.</p>

<p>With a sigh the girl fell back on her pillow, and
tried to coax sleep to come to her. But sleep refused
to come. Instead, the whole panorama of her
Eastern winter unrolled itself before her, peopled
with little fairy sprites, who danced with twinkling
feet and smiled at her mockingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know you," murmured Genevieve,
drowsily. "I know you all. You&mdash;you little black
one&mdash;you're the cake I forgot in the oven, and let
burn up. And you're the lessons I didn't learn&mdash;there
are heaps of you! And you&mdash;you're those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
horrid scales I never could catch up with. My, how
you run now! And you&mdash;you little shamed one
over in the corner&mdash;you're the prank I played on
Miss Jane.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, you can dance now&mdash;but you
won't, by and by! Next year there won't be any of
you&mdash;not a one left. I'm going to be so good, so
awfully good; and I'm not going to ever forget, or
to cause anybody any trouble, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a start Genevieve sat erect in her berth, fully
awake.</p>

<p>"Mercy! What a jounce that was!" she cried,
just above her breath. "But we seem to be going
all right now."</p>

<p>Cautiously she parted her curtains and peeped
out again. The next instant she almost gave a little
shriek: she was looking straight into Bertha
Brown's upraised, startled eyes, just below her.</p>

<p>"Was that an accident?" chattered Bertha. "I
told you there'd be one! I'm all dressed, anyhow&mdash;if
'tis!"</p>

<p>"Sh-h! No, goosey," chuckled Genevieve.</p>

<p>She would have said more but, at that moment,
from up the aisle sounded a sibilant "S-s-s-s!"
They turned to see a somewhat untidy fluff of red
hair above a laughing, piquant face.</p>

<p>"It's Tilly! She's motioning to us. Say, let's
go," whispered Genevieve. And cautiously she began
to let herself down from her perch.</p>

<p>The next moment Bertha, fully dressed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Genevieve in her long, dark blue kimono, were tripping
softly up the aisle.</p>

<p>"Why, you're both down here," exulted Genevieve,
as she climbed into the lower berth.</p>

<p>"Yes; Cordelia was afraid," giggled Tilly, "so
I came down."</p>

<p>"Tilly!&mdash;I was not," disputed Cordelia, in an
indignant whisper. "You came of your own accord."</p>

<p>"Pooh! Tilly's fooling, and we know it,"
soothed Bertha, climbing into the berth after Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Why, Bertha Brown, you've got your shoes
on!" gasped Tilly, forgetting to whisper.</p>

<p>"Of course I have," retorted Bertha. "Do you
suppose&mdash;sh!"</p>

<p>There was a tug at the curtains, and Elsie Martin's
round, good-natured face peered in.</p>

<p>"Well, I like this," she bridled. "A special
meeting of the Hexagon Club, and me not notified!
I heard Genevieve and Bertha giggling in the aisle.
Are you all here?"</p>

<p>"All but Alma," rejoined Tilly, in an exultant
whisper. "Say, get her, too!"</p>

<p>"Well, now, if this isn't just a lark," crowed
Bertha, gleefully, when the last of the six girls had
crowded themselves into the narrow berth.</p>

<p>"Ouch! my head," groaned Genevieve, as a soft
thud threw the other girls into stifled laughter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pooh! I've been hitting my head against the
up-stairs flat ever since I went to bed," quoth Elsie.
"Isn't it fun! Now let's talk."</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"Texas, of course," cut in Tilly. "Girls, girls,
wouldn't it be glorious to give our Texas yell,
though, and see what happened!"</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped the shocked Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't going to, of course," chuckled
Tilly, softly. "I was just imaginin', you know."</p>

<p>"But even this&mdash;I'm not sure we ought&mdash;" began
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"No, of course not; you never are, Cordy,"
agreed Tilly, smoothly.</p>

<p>"But let's talk Texas&mdash;we can whisper, you
know. Tell us about Texas, Genevieve," cut in
pacifier Alma, hurriedly. "What's it like&mdash;the
ranch?"</p>

<p>Genevieve drew a happy sigh.</p>

<p>"Why, it's like&mdash;it's like nothing in Texas, we
think," she breathed. "Of course we don't think
any other ranch could come up to the Six Star!"</p>

<p>Tilly gave a sudden cry.</p>

<p>"The what?"</p>

<p>"The Six Star&mdash;our ranch, you know."</p>

<p>"You mean it's named the 'Six Star Ranch'?"
demanded Tilly.</p>

<p>"Sure! Didn't I ever tell you?" retorted Genevieve
in plain surprise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Tilly clapped her hands softly.</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> you! Well, I should say not! You've always
called it just 'the ranch.' And now&mdash;why,
girls, don't you see?&mdash;it's <i>our</i> ranch. It couldn't
have had a better name if we'd had it built to order.
It's the Six Star Ranch&mdash;and we're the six star
girls&mdash;the Happy Hexagons. And to think we
never knew it before!"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of half-stifled exclamations
of delight; then Cordelia demanded anxiously:</p>

<p>"But, Genevieve, will they be glad to see us,
really&mdash;all your people out there?"</p>

<p>"Glad! I reckon they will be," averred Genevieve,
warmly. "The boys will give us a rousing
welcome, and there won't be anything too good for
Mr. Tim and Mammy Lindy to do."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" asked Tilly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tim is the ranch foreman, 'the boss,' the
boys call him. He's been with us ever since I can
remember, and he's so good to me! Mammy Lindy
is&mdash;well, Mammy Lindy is a dear! You'll love
Ol' Mammy. She's been just a mother to me ever
since my own mother died eight years ago." Genevieve's
voice faltered a little, then went on more
firmly. "She's a negro woman, you know. Her
people were slaves, once."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the&mdash;boys?" asked Cordelia, dubiously.
"Are they your&mdash;brothers, Genevieve?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve laughed&mdash;a little more loudly than
perhaps she realized.</p>

<p>"Brothers!&mdash;well, hardly! The boys are the
cowboys&mdash;on the ranch, you know. My, but they'll
give us a welcome! I reckon they'll ride into town
to give it, too, in all their war paint. Just you wait
till you see the boys&mdash;and hear them!" And Genevieve
laughed again.</p>

<p>All in the dark Cordelia looked distinctly shocked;
but, being in the dark, nobody noticed it.</p>

<p>"Well, I for one just can't wait," began Tilly,
hugging herself with her arms about her knees.
"Only think, it'll be whole days <i>now</i> before we get
there, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Young ladies!"</p>

<p>Tilly stopped with a little cry of dismay. A man's
voice had spoken close to her ear.</p>

<p>"Young ladies," came the mellow tones again. "I
begs yo' pardon, but de lady what belongs down in
number ten says maybe you done forgot dat dis am
a <i>sleepin'</i> car."</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia!" breathed Genevieve. "She's
number ten."</p>

<p>"She sent the porter," gasped Cordelia. "How&mdash;how
awful!&mdash;and you're in my house, too," she
almost sobbed.</p>

<p>"Now I know we're playing house," tittered
Alma Lane, hysterically, as she followed Genevieve
out of the berth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more in her own quarters, Genevieve lay
back on her pillow with a remorseful sigh.</p>

<p>"I don't see why it's so much easier to <i>say</i> you'll
never give anybody any trouble than 'tis to <i>do</i> it,"
she lamented, as she turned over with a jerk.</p>

<p>The girls began the "Chronicles of the Hexagon
Club" the next morning. Genevieve made the first
entry. She dwelt at some length on the confusion
of the train-taking, both at Sunbridge and Boston.
She also had something to say of Tilly Mack. She
gave a full account, too, of the midnight session
of the Hexagon Club in Cordelia's berth.</p>

<p>"And I'm ashamed that Aunt Julia had to be
ashamed of me so soon," she wrote contritely.</p>

<p>Cordelia Wilson had agreed to make the second
entry in the book; but the heat, the loss of sleep,
and the strangeness and excitement added to her
distress that "her house" should have been made
to seem a disgrace in the eyes of the whole car, all
conspired to make her feel so ill that she declared
she could not think of writing for a day or
two.</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you sha'n't write; we'll hand
the book to Tilly," said Genevieve, "and then we'll
give it to some of the others. But I'll tell you what
we will do, Cordelia; you shall make the last entry
in the book just before we leave the train at Bolo.
And you can make it a sort of retrospect&mdash;a 'review
lesson' of the whole, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I thought the others&mdash;won't they each
tell their day?"</p>

<p>"That's <i>just</i> what they'll tell&mdash;their day," retorted
Genevieve, whimsically. "You <i>know</i> what
most of them are. Alma Lane would be all right,
and would give a true description of everything;
only she would go into particulars so, that she would
tell everything she saw from the windows, and just
what she had to eat all day, down to the last
olive."</p>

<p>"I know," nodded Cordelia, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"As for Tilly&mdash;you can't get real sense, of
course, from her part. If there's any nonsense going,
Tilly Mack will find it and trot it out. Bertha
Brown will take up the most of her space by saying
'I always said that&mdash;' etc., etc. Bertha is a dear&mdash;but
you know she does just love to say 'I told
you so.' Elsie will write clothes, of course. We
shall find out what everybody has on when Elsie
writes."</p>

<p>Cordelia laughed aloud&mdash;then clapped her hand
to her aching head.</p>

<p>"You poor dear! What a shame," sympathized
Genevieve. "But, Cordelia, why does Elsie think
so much of clothes? Mercy! for my part I think
they're the most tiresome sort of things to bother
with; and it's such a waste of time to be having
to change your dress always!"</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled; then her face sobered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Elsie! I'm sorry for Elsie. She does
have such an unhappy time over clothes."</p>

<p>"Why? How?&mdash;or isn't it fair to tell?" added
Genevieve, with quick loyalty.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it's fair. Everybody knows it, 'most,
and I supposed you did. Elsie herself tells of it.
You know she lives with her aunt, Mrs. Gale.
Well, Mrs. Gale has three daughters, Fannie, about
twenty-one, I guess, and the twins, nineteen; and
she just loves to make over their things for Elsie&mdash;so
she does it."</p>

<p>"Are they so very&mdash;poor, then?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they aren't poor at all. I don't think
she really has to do it. Aunt Mary says she's just
naturally thrifty, and that she loves to make them
over. But you see, poor Elsie almost never has
a new dress&mdash;of new material, I mean. Now
Elsie loves red; but Fannie wears blue a lot,
and the twins like queer shades like faded-out
greens and browns which Elsie abhors. Poor
Elsie&mdash;no wonder she's always looking at
clothes!"</p>

<p>"Hm-m; no wonder," nodded Genevieve, her
pitying eyes on Elsie far down the aisle&mdash;Elsie,
who, in a mustard-colored striped skirt and pongee
blouse, was at that moment trying to perk up the
loppy blue bows on a somewhat faded tan straw
hat. "Well, anyhow," added Genevieve, with a
sigh, "just remember, Cordelia, that you're to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the last day of the trip in the Chronicles. Now lie
down and give your poor head a rest."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Long before the last day of the journey came,
Cordelia had quite recovered from her headache;
but, in accordance with Genevieve's plan, she did
not add her share to the Chronicles until the appointed
time. Then, with almost a reverent air,
she accepted the book and pen from Genevieve's
hands, and returned to the seclusion of her seat,
rejoicing that Tilly was playing checkers with
Bertha, and so would not, presumably, disturb her&mdash;for
a time, at least.</p>

<p>"To-day, at noon, we are to arrive at Bolo," she
wrote a little unevenly; then with a firmer hand
she went on. "Genevieve says this ought to be a
retrospect, and touch lightly upon the whole trip;
so I will try to make it so.</p>

<p>"It has been a beautiful journey. Nothing serious
has happened, though Bertha has worn her shoes
all the time expecting it. The best thing, so far,
was our lovely day in Washington that Mr. Hartley
gave us, and the President. (I mean, we saw him
and he smiled.) And the worst thing (except that
first night in my berth that Genevieve wrote of)
was the time we lost Tilly for three whole hours,
and Mrs. Kennedy got so nervous and white and
frightened. We supposed, of course, she had fallen
off, or jumped off, or got left off at some station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
But just as we were talking with the porter about
telegraphing everywhere, she danced in with two
very untidy, unclean little Armenian children. It
seems she had been in the emigrant car all the time
playing with the children and trying to make the
men and women talk their queer English. I never
knew that gentle Mrs. Kennedy could speak so
sharply as she did then to Tilly.</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;since Tuesday, some time&mdash;we
have really been in Texas. Some things look just
like Eastern things, but others are so strange and
queer. It is very hot&mdash;I mean, very warm, too.
But then, we have just as warm days in Sunbridge,
I guess. The windmills look so queer&mdash;there are
such a lot of them; but they look pretty, too. Some
of the towns are very pretty, also, with their red
roofs and blue barns and houses. Genevieve says
lots of them are German villages.</p>

<p>"In some places lots of things are growing, but
in others it is all just gray and bare-looking with
nothing much growing except those queer prairie-dog
cities with the funny little creatures sitting on
top of their houses, or popping down into their
holes only to turn around and look at you out of
their bright little eyes. We had a splendid chance
to see them once when our train stopped right in
the middle of a prairie for a long time. We got off
and walked quite a way with Mr. Hartley. I saw
a rattlesnake, and I'm afraid I screamed. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
screamed again when the horrid thing wiggled into
one of the dog houses. Mr. Hartley says they live
together sometimes, but if I were that dog he
wouldn't live with me!</p>

<p>"We have seen lots of cattle and goats and hogs&mdash;though
Tilly says she hasn't seen any of the
latter under any gate yet. I have seen a mesquite
tree (so I have done one of my things), and it <i>does</i>
have thorns. We are on another prairie now, and
oh, how big it is, and such a lot of grass as there
is on it&mdash;just as far as you can see, grass, grass,
grass! I guess there won't be any danger of my not
having plenty of that to take home. I have seen
lots of men on horseback, but I don't know whether
they were cowboys or not. They did not shoot, anyway,
but some of them did yell.</p>

<p>"Genevieve says cowboys are to meet us, and
that probably they will come away to Bolo in full
war paint. I thought it was only Indians who
painted&mdash;except silly ladies, of course&mdash;and I was
going to say so; but Tilly was there, so I didn't
like to. Of course I ought not to mind the cowboys&mdash;if
Genevieve likes them, and they are her
friends; but I can't help remembering what Mrs.
Miller told me about their 'shooting up towns' in
a very dreadful way when they were angry. I hope
none of the men I want to find will turn out to be
cowboys." (Here there were signs of an attempted
erasure, but the words still stood, and immediately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
after them came another sentence.) "That is, I
mean I should hate to find that any friends of mine
had become cowboys.</p>

<p>"I have just been reading over what I have written,
and I am disappointed in it. I am sure I ought
to have mentioned a great many things about which
I have been silent. But there were so many things,
and they all crowded at once before me, so that I
had to just touch on the big things and the tall
things&mdash;like windmills, for instance.</p>

<p>"We are getting nearer Bolo now, and I must
stop and eat some luncheon, Genevieve says, as we
sha'n't have anything else till supper on the ranch.
Oh, I am so excited! Seems as if I couldn't draw
a breath deep enough. And the idea of trying to
eat when I feel like this!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>THE BOYS PREPARE A WELCOME</h3>


<p>On the back gallery of the long, low ranch house,
the boys were waiting for Teresa to ring the bell
for supper. Comfortably they lolled about on hammocks,
chairs, and steps, with their shirts open at
the neck and plentifully powdered with the dust of
the corral.</p>

<p>From the doorway, Tim Nolan, the ranch foreman,
spoke to them hurriedly.</p>

<p>"See here, boys, I'm right sorry, but I've got to
see Benson to-morrow about those steers. That
means that I've got to go as far as Bolo to-night,
and that I sha'n't be back in time to start with the
rest of you to meet the folks. But I'll see you in
Bolo day after to-morrow at noon. The train is
due then. Now be on hand, all of you that can.
We want Miss Genevieve and her friends to have a
right royal welcome. I reckon now I'd better be
off. So long! Now remember&mdash;day after to-morrow
at noon!" he finished, turning away.</p>

<p>"As if we'd be a-forgettin' it," grinned Long
John, a tall, lank fellow sprawled in a hammock,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
"when the little mistress hain't set her pretty foot
on the place since last August!"</p>

<p>"If only she wa'n't bringin' all them others,"
groaned the short, sandy-haired man on the steps.
"I'd just like to rope the whole bunch and send 'em
back East again, old lady and all&mdash;all but the little
mistress, of course. Boys, what are we a-goin' to
do with an old lady&mdash;even though she ain't so
awful old&mdash;and five tom-fool girls on the Six Star
Ranch?"</p>

<p>"Ees not the Se&ntilde;orita a gurrl, also?" laughed a
dark-eyed Mexican from his perch on the gallery
railing. "Eh, Reddy?"</p>

<p>"Sure, Pedro," retorted the sandy-haired man,
testily. (Pedro was the only Mexican cowboy at
the ranch, and even he was barely tolerated.) "But
the little mistress ain't no tenderfoot girl. She don't
howl at a rattlesnake nor jump at a prairie dog;
and she knows how to ride, and which end of a gun
goes off!"</p>

<p>There was a general laugh, followed by a long
silence&mdash;the boys did not usually talk so much together,
but to-night a curious restlessness pervaded
them all. Suddenly the tall man in the hammock
pulled himself erect.</p>

<p>"Look a-here, boys, that's jest it," he began in a
worried voice. "What if the little mistress has
changed? What if she hain't no use for us and the
ranch any more? I never told ye, but at the first,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
last August, 'fore she went away, I heard the boss
and Mr. Hartley a-talkin'. They was sayin' she'd
got to go East to learn how to live like a lady
should&mdash;to know girls, and books, and all that.
They said she was runnin' wild here with only us
for playmates, and that they had just got ter pasture
her out where the grass was finer, and the
fences nearer tergether."</p>

<p>"Did they say&mdash;that?" gasped half a dozen
worried voices.</p>

<p>"They sure did&mdash;and more. They said two
real ladies was a-goin' ter take her and make her
like themselves&mdash;a lady. And, boys, I was wonderin'&mdash;how
is a lady goin' ter like us, and the
ranch?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's tense silence. The boys
were staring, wide-eyed and appalled, into each
other's faces.</p>

<p>From somewhere came a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Gorry!&mdash;she can't, she just can't, after all
her book-learnin' and culturin'," groaned a new
voice.</p>

<p>For a time no one spoke; then Reddy cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"Look a-here, there ain't but jest one thing to
do. If she don't like the ranch&mdash;and us&mdash;we'll
jest have to make the ranch&mdash;and us&mdash;so she will
like 'em."</p>

<p>"How?" demanded a skeptical chorus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Slick 'em up&mdash;and us," retorted the sandy-haired
man, with finality. "I was raised East, and
I know the sort of doin's they hanker after. To-morrow
mornin' we'll begin. I'll show you; you'll
see," he finished in a louder tone, as Teresa's clanging
supper bell sent them in a stampede through
the long covered way that led to the dining-room
which, with the cook room, occupied the large, low
building thirty feet to the rear of the ranch house.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When Tim Nolan arrived at the Bolo station a
little before noon two days later, he stared in open-mouthed
wonder at the sight that greeted his eyes.
In a wavering, straggling line stood ten stiff, red-faced,
miserable men, dressed in what was, to Tim
Nolan, the strangest assortment of garments he had
ever seen.</p>

<p>Two of the men were in dead black, from head
to foot. Four wore stiff, not over-clean white shirts.
Six sported flaming red neckties. One had unearthed
from somewhere a frock coat three sizes
too small for him, which he wore very proudly,
however, over a flannel shirt adorned with a red-and-green
silk handkerchief knotted at the throat.
Another displayed a somewhat battered silk hat.
But, whatever they wore, each showed a face upon
which hope, despair, pride, shame, and physical
misery were curiously blended.</p>

<p>For an instant Tim Nolan peered at them with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
unrecognizing eyes; then he gave a low ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Reddy! Carlos! Jim! Boys!" he gasped.
"What in the world is the meaning of this?"</p>

<p>"Eet ees that we welcome the little Se&ntilde;orita an'
her frien's," bowed Pedro, doffing his sombrero
which was the only part of his usual costume that
he had retained.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;I don't understand," demurred the foreman;
"these rigs of yours! Reddy, where in time
did you corral that coat?"</p>

<p>Reddy shifted from one uneasy foot to the other.</p>

<p>"Pedro's told you&mdash;we're here to welcome the
little mistress, of course. We've slicked up. We&mdash;we
didn't want the shock too sudden&mdash;from the
East, you know."</p>

<p>For another moment Tim Nolan stared; then
he threw back his head and laughed&mdash;laughed till
the faces of the men before him grew red with
something more than discomfort.</p>

<p>At that moment a pretty young girl in khaki and
a cowboy hat made her appearance astride a frisky
little mustang. She wore a cartridge belt about her
waist&mdash;though there was no revolver in her holster.</p>

<p>"Is Genevieve coming to-day, sure?" she called
out joyfully. "I heard she was, and I've come to
meet her."</p>

<p>"There, boys," bantered the ranch foreman,
"now here's a young lady who knows how to welcome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the mistress of the Six Star Ranch!" Then,
to the girl: "Sure, Miss Susie, we do expect Genevieve,
and we're here to welcome her, as you see,"
he finished with a sweep of his broad-brimmed
hat.</p>

<p>It looked, for a moment, as if the wavering, straggling
men would break ranks and run; but a sudden
distant whistle, and a sharp command from
Reddy brought them right about face.</p>

<p>"Buck up, boys," he ordered sharply. "I reckon
the little mistress ain't a-goin' ter turn us down!
She'll like it. You'll see!"</p>

<p>The train had scarcely come to a stop before
Genevieve was off the car steps.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tim, Mr. Tim&mdash;here I am! Oh, how
good you look!" she cried, holding out both her
hands. A minute later she turned to introduce the
embarrassed foreman to Mrs. Kennedy and the girls,
who, with her father, were following close at her
heels. This task was not half completed, however,
when she spied the red-faced, anxious-eyed men.</p>

<p>As Mr. Tim had done, she stared dumbly for a
moment; then, leaving the rest of the introductions
to her father, she ran toward them.</p>

<p>"Why, it's the boys&mdash;our boys! Carlos, Long
John, Reddy! But what <i>is</i> the matter? How queer
you look! Is anybody sick&mdash;or&mdash;dead?" she
stammered, plainly in doubt what to say.</p>

<p>"Sure, it's for you&mdash;we're a-welcomin' you,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
exploded Long John, jerking at his collar which was
obviously too small for him.</p>

<p>Genevieve's face showed a puzzled frown.</p>

<p>"But these clothes!&mdash;why are you like this?&mdash;and
after all I've promised the girls about you, too!"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;you don't like it&mdash;this?" demanded
Reddy, incredulous hope in his eyes and
voice.</p>

<p>"Of course I don't like it! I've been promising
the girls all the way here that you'd give them a
welcome that <i>was</i> a welcome! And now&mdash;but why
did you do it, boys?"</p>

<p>Long John drew himself to his full height.</p>

<p>"Why? 'Cause Reddy said to," he answered.
"Reddy said we'd better ease up on the shock it
would be to you&mdash;here, after all you'd been used
to back East&mdash;fine clothes, fine feed, and fine doin's
all around, to say nothin' of books and learnin' in
between times; so we&mdash;we tried to break ye in
easy. That's all," he finished, a little lamely.</p>

<p>"And then these clothes mean&mdash;that?" demanded
the girl.</p>

<p>Long John nodded dumbly.</p>

<p>Genevieve gave a ringing laugh, but her eyes
grew soft as she extended her hand to each man in
turn.</p>

<p>"What old dears you are&mdash;every one of you!"
she exclaimed. "Now go home quick, and get
comfortable." She would have said more, but some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
one called her and she turned abruptly. Cordelia
Wilson, looking half frightened, half exultant, but
wholly excited, was pulling at her sleeve.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, Genevieve, quick," she was panting;
"is that a cowboy&mdash;that, over there&mdash;talking to
your father?"</p>

<p>Genevieve turned with a wondering frown. The
next moment she burst into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cordelia, Cordelia, you will be the death of
me, yet! No, that isn't a cowboy. It's Susie Billings.
She lives on a ranch near here."</p>

<p>"A girl&mdash;dressed like that&mdash;and carrying a
revolver! Just a common 'Susie!'" gasped Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;just a common 'Susie,'" twinkled
Genevieve.</p>

<p>"But I thought she was a&mdash;a cowboy," quavered
Cordelia. "You <i>said</i> they'd be here in&mdash;in all
their war paint!"</p>

<p>From behind them sounded a muffled snort and
a low-voiced:</p>

<p>"Boys, she thinks that's a cowboy! Come on&mdash;say
we show 'em! Eh?"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed softly at what Cordelia had
said, and at the disappointment in her voice.</p>

<p>"Cowboys? Well, they <i>are</i> here," she acknowledged
with twitching lips, "and in their war paint,
too&mdash;of a kind! They're right here&mdash;Why,
they're <i>gone</i>," she broke off. "Never mind," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
laughed, as she caught sight of a silk hat and a black
coat hurrying toward a group of saddled ponies.
"I reckon you'll see all the cowboys you want to
before you go back East again. Now come up and
meet Susie&mdash;and she hasn't, really, any revolver
there, Cordelia, in spite of that cartridge belt and
holster. She's always rigging up that way. She
likes it!"</p>

<p>Susie proved to be "a girl just like us," as Cordelia
amazedly expressed it to Alma Lane. She
was certainly a very pleasant one, they all decided.
But even Susie could not keep their eyes from wandering
to the unfamiliar scene around them.</p>

<p>It was a bare little station set in the midst of a
bare little prairie town, and quite unlike anything
the Easterners had ever seen before. Broad, dusty
streets led seemingly nowhere. Low, straggling
houses stretched out lazy lengths of untidiness, except
where a group of taller, more pretentious buildings
indicated the stores, a hotel or two, several
boarding houses, and numerous saloons and dance
halls.</p>

<p>From the station doorway, a blanketed Indian
looked out with stolid, unsmiling face. Leaning
against a post a dreamy-eyed Mexican in tight
trousers, red sash, and tall peaked hat, smoked a
cigarette. Halfway down the platform a tired-looking
man in heavy cowhide boots and rough
clothes, watched beside a huge canvas-topped wagon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
beyond which could be seen the switching tails of
six great oxen.</p>

<p>"There's Fred's 'boat,'" remarked Bertha,
laughingly, to Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Where? What?" Cordelia had been trying to
look in all directions at once.</p>

<p>"That prairie schooner down there."</p>

<p>"Now that looks like the pictures," asserted
Cordelia. "I wonder if the cowboys will."</p>

<p>"I declare, the whole thing is worse than a three-ring
circus," declared Tilly, aggrievedly, to Genevieve.
"I simply can't see everything!"</p>

<p>"All aboard for the ranch," called Mr. Hartley,
leading the way around to the other side of the
station; and like a flock of prairie chickens, as
Genevieve put it, they all trooped after him.</p>

<p>"Why, what funny horses!" cried Tilly, as Mr.
Hartley stopped before a large, old-fashioned three-seated
carriage drawn up to the platform.</p>

<p>At Genevieve's chuckling laugh, Tilly threw a
sharper glance toward the two gray creatures attached
to the carriage.</p>

<p>"Why, they aren't horses at all&mdash;yes, they are&mdash;no,
they aren't, either!"</p>

<p>"I always heard young ladies were a bit changeable,"
grinned Tim Nolan, mischievously; "but do
they always change their minds as often as that,
Miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they do&mdash;when the occasion demands it,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
retorted Tilly, with a merry glance; and Tim Nolan
laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"Well, they aren't horses," smiled Mr. Hartley,
as he gave his hand to help Mrs. Kennedy into the
carriage. "They happen to be mules. Now, Miss
Tilly, if you'll come in here with Mrs. Kennedy,
we'll put two other young ladies and myself in the
other two seats, and leave Genevieve to do the
honors in one of the ranch wagons with the rest of
you. The baggage, the boys are already putting in
the other wagon, I see," he added, looking back to
where two men were busy with a pile of trunks and
bags. "They'll come along after us. Mr. Tim is
on his horse, of course. We'll let him show us the
way. Now stow yourselves comfortably," he admonished
his guests. "You know we have an
eighteen-mile ride ahead of us!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>CORDELIA SEES A COWBOY</h3>


<p>Through the broad, dusty streets, by the straggling
houses, and out on to the boundless sea of
grass trailed the carriage and the ranch wagons,
with Mr. Tim in the lead.</p>

<p>Five pairs of eyes grew wide with wonder and
awe.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose anything in the world could be
so&mdash;so far," breathed Cordelia, who was with Mr.
Hartley on the front seat of the carriage.</p>

<p>"No wonder Genevieve was always talking about
'space, wide, wide space,'" cried Bertha. "Why,
it's just like the ocean&mdash;only more so, because
there aren't any waves."</p>

<p>"As if anything could be more like the ocean
than the ocean itself," giggled Tilly.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Miss Bertha," he nodded. "Just
you wait till there's a little more wind, and you'll
see some waves, I reckon. It's mighty still just
now; and yet&mdash;there, look! Over there to the
right&mdash;see?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>They all looked, and they all saw. They saw far
in the distance the green change to gray, and the
gray to faint purple, and back again to green, while
curious shifting lights and shadows glancing across
the waving blades of grass, made them ripple like
water in the sunlight. At the same time, from
somewhere, came a soft, cool wind.</p>

<p>"Why, it is&mdash;it is just like the ocean," exulted
Cordelia. "I've seen it look like that down to Nantasket,
'way, 'way off at sea."</p>

<p>"I told you 'twas," triumphed Bertha.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," observed Tilly, demurely,
"they must be awfully dry waves&mdash;not much fun
to jump!"</p>

<p>"Tilly, how can you?" protested Cordelia.
"How you do take the poetry out of anything!
I believe you'd take the poetry out of&mdash;of Shakespeare
himself!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! Never saw much in him to take out,"
shrugged Tilly.</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Tilly can't see poetry in anything that doesn't
jingle like 'If you love me as I love you, no knife
can cut our love in two,'" chanted Bertha.</p>

<p>"My dears!" remonstrated Mrs. Kennedy,
feebly.</p>

<p>Tilly turned with swift pacification.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Mrs. Kennedy. I'm used to
it. They can't trouble me any!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Mr. Hartley who broke the silence that
followed.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cordelia," he asked laughingly,
"what is the matter? You've been peering in all
directions, and you look as if you hadn't found
what you were hunting for. You weren't expecting
to find soda fountains and candy stores on the
prairie, were you?"</p>

<p>Cordelia smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Of course not, Mr. Hartley! I was looking for
the blue bonnets&mdash;the flowers, you know. Genevieve
said they grew wild all through the prairie
grass."</p>

<p>"And so they do&mdash;specially, early in the spring,
my dear. I wish you could see them, then."</p>

<p>"I wish I could&mdash;Genevieve has told me so
much about them. She says they're the state flower.
I thought they had such a funny name; I wanted
to pick one, if I could. She says they're lovely,
too."</p>

<p>"They are, indeed, and I wish you could see
them when they are at their best," rejoined Mr.
Hartley; then he turned to Bertha, who had been
listening with evident interest. "In the spring it's
a blue ocean, Miss Bertha&mdash;I wish you could see
the wind sweep across it then! And I wish you
could smell it, too," he added with a laugh. "I
reckon you wouldn't think it much like your salty,
fishy east wind," he finished, twinkling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, but we just love that salty, fishy east wind,
every time we go near the shore," retorted a chorus
of loyal Eastern voices; and Mr. Hartley laughed
again.</p>

<p>In the ranch wagon behind them, Genevieve was
doing the honors of the prairie right royally. Here,
there, and everywhere she was pointing out something
of interest. In the ranch wagon, too, the
marvelous hush and charm of limitless distance had
wrought its own spell; and all had fallen silent.</p>

<p>It was Alma Lane who broke the pause.</p>

<p>"What are all those deep, narrow paths, such a
lot of them, running parallel to the wheel tracks?"
she asked curiously. "I've been watching them ever
since we left Bolo. They are on both sides, too."</p>

<p>"They're made by the cattle," answered Genevieve;
"such a lot of them, you know, traveling
single file on their way to Bolo. Bolo is a 'cow
town'&mdash;that is, they ship cattle to market from
there."</p>

<p>"Poor things," sighed Elsie, sympathetically.
"I saw some yesterday from the train. I thought
then I never wanted to eat another piece of beefsteak&mdash;and
I adore beefsteak, too."</p>

<p>Genevieve sobered a little.</p>

<p>"I know it; I know just how you feel. I hate
that part&mdash;but it's business, I suppose. I reckon
I hate business, anyhow&mdash;but I love the ranch!
I can't get used to the branding, either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>Genevieve shook her head. A look of pain crossed
her face.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me, Elsie, please. You'll find out
soon enough. Branding is business, too, I suppose&mdash;but
it's horrid. Mammy Lindy says that
the first time I saw our brand on a calf and realized
what it meant and how it got there, I cried for
hours&mdash;for days, in fact, much of the time."</p>

<p>"Why, Genevieve," cried Elsie, wonderingly.
"How dreadful! What is a brand? I thought
'brand' meant the kind of coffee or tea one drank."</p>

<p>Alma frowned and threw a quick look into Genevieve's
face.</p>

<p>"What a funny little town Bolo is!" she exclaimed,
with a swift change of subject. "I declare,
it looked 'most as sleepy as Sunbridge."</p>

<p>"Sleepy!" laughed Genevieve, her face clearing,
much to Alma's satisfaction. "You should see Bolo
when it's really awake&mdash;say when some association
of cattlemen meet there. And there's going to be
one next month, I think. There's no end of fun
and frolic and horse-racing then, with everybody
there, from the cowboys and cattle-kings to the
trappers and Indians. You wouldn't think there
was anything sleepy about Bolo then, I reckon,"
nodded Genevieve, gayly.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, quick&mdash;look!&mdash;off there," cried
Elsie, excitedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some more of Fred's 'boats'&mdash;three of them
this time," laughed Alma, her eyes on the three
white-topped wagons glistening in the sunlight.</p>

<p>"Boats?" questioned Genevieve.</p>

<p>"That's what little Fred Wilson told us we were
going to ride in," explained Alma. "He said they
had prairie schooners here, and schooners were
boats, of course."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"I wish Fred could see these 'boats,'" she said.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; I feel as if they were
boats," declared Alma, stoutly. "I'm sure I don't
think anybody on the ocean could be any more glad
to see a sail than I should be to see one of these,
if I were a lonely traveler on this sea of grass!"</p>

<p>"But where are they going?" questioned Elsie.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;nor do they, probably," rejoined
Genevieve, with a quizzical smile. "They're
presumably emigrants hunting up cheap land for a
new home. There used to be lots of them, Father
says; but there aren't so many now. See&mdash;they're
going to cross our way just ahead of us. We'll get
a splendid view of them."</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the curiously clumsy,
yet curiously airy-looking wagons. Sallow-faced
women looked out mournfully, and tow-headed
children peeped from every vantage point. Brawny,
but weary-looking men stalked beside their teams.</p>

<p>"Look at the men&mdash;<i>walking!</i>" cried Elsie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're 'bull-whackers,'" nodded Genevieve,
mischievously.</p>

<p>"Bull-whackers!"</p>

<p>"Yes, because their teams happen to be oxen;
if they were mules, now, they'd be 'mule-skinners.'"</p>

<p>"Is that what you are, then?" asked Elsie, with
a demureness that rivaled Tilly's best efforts.
"You're driving mules, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, you better not call me that," laughed
Genevieve. "See, they've stopped to speak to
Father. I reckon we'll have to stop, too."</p>

<p>"I 'reckon' we shall," mimicked Elsie, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"They've got all their household goods and gods
in those wagons," said Genevieve, musingly. "I
can see a tin coffeepot hanging straight over one
woman's head."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think they had anything but children,"
laughed Alma, as from every wagon there
tumbled a scrambling, squirming mass of barefoot
legs, thin brown arms, and touseled hair above wide,
questioning eyes.</p>

<p>Long minutes later, from the carriage, Cordelia
Wilson followed with dreamy eyes the slow-receding
wagons, now again upon their way.</p>

<p>"I feel just like 'ships that pass in the night,'"
she murmured.</p>

<p>"I don't. I feel just like supper," whispered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Tilly. Then she laughed at the frightened look
Cordelia flung at Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>On and on through the shimmering heat, under
the cloudless sky, trailed the carriage and the ranch
wagons. Mr. Tim had long ago galloped out of
sight.</p>

<p>It was when they were within five miles of the
ranch that Cordelia, looking far ahead, saw against
the horizon a rapidly growing black speck. For
some time she watched it in silence; then, suddenly,
she became aware that, large as was the speck now,
it had broken into other specks&mdash;bobbing, shifting
specks that promptly became not specks at all, but
men on horseback.</p>

<p>Spasmodically she clutched Mr. Hartley's arm.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;are&mdash;those?" she questioned, with
dry lips.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley gave an indifferent glance ahead.</p>

<p>"Cowboys, I should say," he answered.</p>

<p>Cordelia caught her breath. At that moment a
shot rang out, then another, and another.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley looked up now, sharply, a little
angrily. The indifference was quite gone from his
face.</p>

<p>It was then that Genevieve's voice came clear and
strong from the wagon behind.</p>

<p>"It's the boys, Father&mdash;our boys!" she called.
"I know it's the boys. I told them I'd promised
the girls a welcome, and they're giving it to us!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"By George! it is our boys," breathed Mr. Hartley.
And the scowl on his face gave way to a
broad smile.</p>

<p>"Is it really all&mdash;fun?" quavered Cordelia,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Every bit," Mr. Hartley assured her. And
then&mdash;though still breathlessly&mdash;Cordelia gave
herself up to the excitement of the moment.</p>

<p>They were all about them soon&mdash;those lithe,
supple figures, swaying lightly, or sitting superbly
erect in their saddles. From the top of their broad-brimmed
hats to the tips of their high-heeled cowboy
boots they were a wonder and a joy to the
amazed eyes of Cordelia. With stirrups so long
the chains clanked musically, they galloped back and
forth, shouting, laughing, and shooting wildly into
the air. With their chaparejos, or leather overalls,
their big revolvers, their spurs, their bright silk
handkerchiefs knotted loosely around their necks
over the open collar of their flannel shirts, they made
a brave show, indeed. Nor was the least of the
wonders about them the graceful swirls of loosely-coiled
lariats hanging from the horns of their saddles.</p>

<p>After all, it lasted only a minute before the revolvers
were thrust into the waiting holsters, and
before the men, bareheaded, were making a sweeping
bow from their saddles.</p>

<p>It was Genevieve who led the clapping.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, boys, thank you! That was fine&mdash;just
fine!" she crowed. "Now I reckon Cordelia thinks
she has seen a cowboy all right!"</p>

<p>And Cordelia did. A little white, but bravely
smiling, she was sitting erect, apparently serene.
And only Mr. Hartley knew that one of her hands
was clutched about his arm in a grasp that actually
hurt.</p>

<p>"They did that&mdash;all that shooting and yelling&mdash;just
for a joke, then?" she asked Mr. Hartley, a
little later.</p>

<p>"Only that. They were giving you a welcome
to the Six Star Ranch."</p>

<p>"Then they don't act like that all the time?"</p>

<p>"Hardly!" laughed the man. "I reckon they
wouldn't get much work done if they did."</p>

<p>Cordelia drew a relieved sigh. Her eyes, a little
less fearful, rested on the erect figure of the nearest
cowboy, just to the right of the carriage.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she murmured. "I'll tell Mrs.
Miller. She thought they did, you know&mdash;yell always
without just and due provocation, and shoot
at sight."</p>

<p>The man's lips twitched; but the next moment
they grew a bit stern at the corners.</p>

<p>"That's exactly it, Miss Cordelia&mdash;exactly the
idea that some people have of the boys, and I'll
grant that when they&mdash;they drink too much
whiskey, they aren't exactly what you might call<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
peaceable, desirable companions&mdash;though three-fourths
of their antics then are caused by reckless
high spirits rather than by real ugliness&mdash;with exceptions,
of course. But when sober they are quiet,
straightforward, generous-hearted good fellows,
hard-working and honest; certainly my boys are."</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley hesitated, then went on, still gravely.</p>

<p>"There's just as much difference in ranches, of
course, Miss Cordelia, as there is in folks; and all
the ranches are changing fast, anyway, nowadays.
Lots of the owners are quitting living on them at
all. They've gone into the towns to live. On the
Six Star the boys take their meals with the family;
and in many places they don't do that, I know, even
where the owner lives on the ranch. Our boys are
very loyal to us, and very much interested in all
that concerns us. They fairly worship Genevieve,
and have, all the way up."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," murmured Cordelia, again; and
this time there was a look very much like admiration
in the eyes that rested on Long John just
ahead.</p>

<p>It was some time later that Mr. Hartley said,
half turning around:</p>

<p>"Look straight ahead, a little to the right, young
ladies, and you'll get a very good view of the Six
Star Ranch."</p>

<p>"Oh, and you've got a windmill," cried Tilly.
"I can see it against the sky; I know I can!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, we've got a windmill," nodded Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>"I love windmills," exulted Cordelia.</p>

<p>"So does Genevieve," observed Mr. Hartley,
raising his eyebrows a little.</p>

<p>Only Cordelia noticed the odd smile he gave as he
spoke, and she did not know what it meant. Later,
however, she remembered it. She was too much
excited now to think of anything but the fact that
the Six Star Ranch was so near.</p>

<p>Bertha craned her neck to look ahead.</p>

<p>"Only think, we haven't passed a house, not a
house since we left Bolo," she cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley smiled.</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Bertha, Bolo, eighteen miles
away, is our nearest neighbor; and you'll have to
go even farther than that in any other direction
to strike another neighbor."</p>

<p>"My stars!" gasped Bertha. "How awful lonesome
it must be, Mr. Hartley."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, you can't be much bothered with
neighbors running in to borrow two eggs and a
little soda, can you?" giggled Tilly.</p>

<p>"No; that isn't one of the difficulties we have
to deal with," smiled Mr. Hartley; but Bertha
bridled visibly.</p>

<p>"Well, really, Tilly Mack," she exclaimed in pretended
anger, "I should like to know if you mean
anything special! You see," she added laughingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to Mr. Hartley, "I happen to live next to Tilly,
myself!"</p>

<p>From both carriage and wagon, now, came a
babel of eager chatter. There was so much to be
seen on the one hand, so much to be explained on
the other. The buildings and corrals were plainly
visible by this time, and each minute they became
more clearly defined.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that all that belongs to just one
ranch?" demanded Tilly.</p>

<p>"Sure!" twinkled Mr. Hartley. "You see, if
folks can't borrow of us, we can't borrow of them,
either; so it's rather necessary that we have all the
comforts of home ourselves."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you've got them," laughed Tilly,
looking wonderingly about her.</p>

<p>"I reckon we have," nodded Mr. Hartley, as he
began to point out one and another of the buildings.</p>

<p>There was the long, low ranch house facing the
wide reach of the prairie. Behind it, and connected
with it by a covered way, were the dining room and
the cook room. Beyond that was the long bunk
house where the men slept, flanked by another building
for the Mexican servants. There were stables,
sheds, a storehouse and saddle-room, and a blacksmith's
shop. Below the house an oblong bit of
fenced ground showed a riot of color&mdash;Genevieve's
flower garden. Below that was a vegetable garden.
There was a large corral for the cattle, and a smaller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
one, high and circular, for the horses. There were
three or four green trees near the house&mdash;tall, thin
cottonwoods that had grown up along the slender
streams of waste water from the windmill.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>THE RANCH HOUSE</h3>


<p>"And here we are at the Six Star Ranch," cried
Mr. Hartley, as he leaped from the carriage before
the wide-open door of the ranch house. "Well,
Mammy Lindy," he added, as the kindly, wrinkled
old face of a colored woman appeared in the doorway,
"I've corralled the whole bunch and brought
them West with me!"</p>

<p>A little stiffly the girls got down from their seats&mdash;all
but Genevieve. She, in the space of a breath,
seemingly, had leaped to the ground and run up on
to the wide gallery where the negress, with adoring
eyes, awaited her.</p>

<p>"Laws, chil'e," Tilly, who was nearest, heard a
tenderly crooning voice say, "but I am jes' pow'ful
glad to see ye, honey!"</p>

<p>"Mammy, you old darling!" cried Genevieve,
giving the rotund, gayly-clad figure a bear-like hug.
"You look just as good as you used to&mdash;and my,
my! just see all this new finery to welcome me," she
added, holding off her beaming-faced old nurse at
arms' length. "I reckon you'll think something has
come, Mammy Lindy, when we all get settled," she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
added laughingly, as she turned to present the old
woman to Mrs. Kennedy and the girls.</p>

<p>A little later, Tilly, in the wide, center hallway,
was looking wonderingly about her.</p>

<p>"Well, Genevieve Hartley, I didn't think you
<i>could</i> have room enough for us all," she declared;
"but I'll give it up. I should think you
might entertain the whole state of Texas in this
house!"</p>

<p>"We try to, sometimes," laughed Genevieve.
"You know we Texans pride ourselves on always
having room for everybody."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think you did&mdash;and, only think,
all on one floor, too!"</p>

<p>Genevieve did not answer. She was looking
around her with a thoughtful little frown between
her eyebrows as if she saw something she did not
quite understand.</p>

<p>The girls were standing in the wide center hallway
that ran straight through the house. On one
side, through a wide archway, could be seen a large
living-room with piano, bookshelves, comfortable
chairs, a couch, and a good-sized table. Beyond
that there was a narrow hall with two large rooms
leading from it. From the other side of the center
hall opened another narrow hall at right angles,
from which led the six remaining rooms of the
house.</p>

<p>"This is more fun than getting settled in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sleepers," declared Elsie Martin, as Genevieve began
to fly about arranging her guests.</p>

<p>The boys made quick work of bringing in the
trunks and bags; and then for a brief half-hour
there was quiet while eight pairs of hurried hands
attempted to remove part of the dust of travel and
to unearth fresh blouses and clean linen from long-packed
trunks.</p>

<p>It was a hungry, merry crowd, a little later, that
trooped through the long covered way leading to
the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Now I know why this house has got so much
room in it," declared Tilly. "We could have room
in the East if we banished our dining-rooms
and kitchens and pantries to the neighbors like
this!"</p>

<p>Genevieve did not answer. They had reached
the long narrow room with the big table running
lengthwise of it. Only one end of the table was set
with places for eight.</p>

<p>"Why, where are the boys?" questioned Genevieve.</p>

<p>Mammy Lindy shook her head.</p>

<p>"Dey ain't here, chil'e."</p>

<p>"But, Mammy, you are mistaken. They are
here. They came home with us."</p>

<p>"Yas'm, dey done come home, sure 'nuf, but dey
ain't eatin' now, honey."</p>

<p>"Why not?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the old woman shook her head. She did
not answer. She turned troubled eyes first on the
two young Mexican maids by the doorway, then on
Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>"Father, do you know what this means?" demanded
Genevieve.</p>

<p>"No, dearie, I must say I don't," frowned Mr.
Hartley.</p>

<p>"Then I shall find out," avowed the mistress of
the Six Star Ranch. "Mammy Lindy, please seat
my guests, and have the supper served right away.
I'll find Mr. Tim."</p>

<p>"But, my dear," remonstrated Mrs. Kennedy,
gently, "wouldn't it be better if you ate your own
supper first&mdash;with your guests?"</p>

<p>Genevieve shook her head. Her face flushed
painfully.</p>

<p>"I know, Aunt Julia, of course, what you mean.
You don't think it's civil in me to run off like this.
But it's the boys&mdash;something is the matter. They
always eat with us. Why, they may be thinking we
don't <i>want</i> them, Aunt Julia. Please, please excuse
me, everybody," she entreated, as she ran from the
room.</p>

<p>Halfway to the bunk house Genevieve met the
ranch foreman.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Tim, supper is ready. Didn't you
know?" she called, hurrying toward him. "Where
are the boys?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>An odd expression crossed the man's kindly,
weather-beaten face.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're 'round&mdash;in spots."</p>

<p>"Why don't they come to supper?"</p>

<p>Mr. Tim's eyebrows went up.</p>

<p>"Well, as near as I can make out, that's part of
the welcome they're giving you."</p>

<p>"Welcome!&mdash;to stay away from supper!"</p>

<p>Mr. Tim laughed.</p>

<p>"I reckon maybe I'll have to explain," he replied.
"Long John told me they'd got it all fixed up that,
after your fine doings back East, you wouldn't take
to things on the ranch very well. So for two days
the whole bunch has been slicking things up, including
themselves. They hunted up every stiff
hat and b'iled shirt in this part of Texas, I reckon,
for that splurge at Bolo; and Mammy Lindy says
they've been pestering the life out of her, slicking
up the house."</p>

<p>Genevieve drew in her breath with a little cry.</p>

<p>"There! That's what was the matter with the
rooms," she ejaculated. "Nothing looked natural&mdash;but
some things weren't exactly 'slicked up,' Mr.
Tim. I couldn't turn around without finding a book
at my elbow. There's scarcely one left on the
shelves!"</p>

<p>"Maybe I can explain that," returned the man,
with a twinkle in his eyes. "Reddy said the East
was mighty strong on books and culturing, so I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
s'pose he thought he'd have 'em 'round handy. It's
lucky your father had all them books come out while
you was studying, or else I reckon the boys would
have hit the trail for the nearest book-store and
roped every book in sight."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed appreciatively.</p>

<p>"But, the supper?" she frowned again.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's part of the outfit&mdash;and Reddy said
it was 'dinner,' too. He said that he was raised
back East, and that he knew; and that 'twas
more seemly that you ate it without their company."</p>

<p>"Humph! Well, it isn't, and I sha'n't," settled
Genevieve, emphatically. "Where is Reddy? Go
in to supper," she laughed, "and I'll round up the
boys&mdash;I mean, I'll find them," she corrected demurely.
"Miss Jane doesn't like me to say 'round
up,' Mr. Tim."</p>

<p>Mr. Tim smiled, but his eyes grew tender&mdash;almost
anxious.</p>

<p>"I reckon they haven't spoiled you back East,
after all, little girl. You're the same true blue, like
you was, before."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed and colored a little.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," she declared. "Now I'm
going for the boys."</p>

<p>Mr. Tim laid a detaining hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"Not to-night; it's late, and it would make no
end of fuss all around. But I'll tell them. They'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
be on hand for breakfast, all right. Now go back
to your own supper, yourself."</p>

<p>"All right," agreed Genevieve, reluctantly.
"But&mdash;to-morrow, remember!"</p>

<p>"I ain't forgetting&mdash;to-morrow," nodded the
man.</p>

<p>In the dining-room Genevieve was greeted with a
merry clamor, under cover of which she said hurriedly
to her father:</p>

<p>"It's all right. They'll come to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I guess you won't find we've left you much to
eat," gurgled Elsie Martin, her mouth full of fried
chicken.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I shall&mdash;in Texas," retorted Genevieve.</p>

<p>"But I'm so ashamed," apologized Cordelia. "I
don't think we ought to eat so much."</p>

<p>"I do," disagreed Tilly, "when everything is so
perfectly lovely as this is. They are just the nicest
things! And just guess how many hot biscuits I've
eaten with this delicious plum sauce! Mr. Hartley
says they're wild&mdash;the plums, I mean, not the biscuits."</p>

<p>"And it's all such a surprise, too," interposed
Alma Lane; "milk, and butter, and all."</p>

<p>Genevieve stared frankly.</p>

<p>"Surprise!&mdash;<i>milk and butter!</i>" she exclaimed.
"Didn't you suppose we had milk and butter?"</p>

<p>Alma blushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, Genevieve, I&mdash;I didn't mean anything,
you know, truly I didn't," she stammered. "It's
only that&mdash;that ranches don't usually have them,
you know."</p>

<p>"Don't usually have them!" frowned Genevieve.
"Alma Lane, what <i>are</i> you talking
about?"</p>

<p>"Why, we read it, you know, in a book," explained
Cordelia, hastily, coming to the rescue.
"They said in spite of there being so many cows
all around everywhere, there wasn't any butter or
milk, and that the cowboys wouldn't like to be asked
to milk, you know."</p>

<p>"You read it? Where?" Genevieve's forehead
still wore its frown.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley gave a chuckling laugh.</p>

<p>"I reckon Genevieve doesn't know much about
such ranches," he observed. "As I was telling you,
Miss Cordelia, coming out this afternoon, there's
just as much difference in ranches as there is in
folks; and ours happens to be the kind where we
like all the comforts of home pretty well. To be
sure, I wouldn't just like to ask Reddy or Long
John to milk, maybe," he added, with a whimsical
smile; "but I don't have to, you see. I've got
Carlos for just such work. He looks after the
vegetable garden, too, and Genevieve's flowers. By
the way, dearie,"&mdash;he turned to his daughter&mdash;"Tim
says Carlos has been putting in his prettiest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
work on your garden this summer. Be sure you
don't forget to notice it."</p>

<p>"As if I could help noticing it," returned Genevieve.
She was about to say more when there came
an earnest question from Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hartley, please, what did you call those
two men?"</p>

<p>"What men?"</p>

<p>"The ones you&mdash;you wouldn't wish to ask to
milk."</p>

<p>"Oh, the boys? I don't remember&mdash;I reckon
'twas Reddy and Long John that I mentioned,
maybe."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that's the one I mean&mdash;the John
one. What is his other name, please?"</p>

<p>"His surname? Why, really, Miss Cordelia, I
reckon I've forgotten what it is. The boys all go
by their first names, mostly, else by a nickname.
Why? Found a long-lost friend?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir. Well, I mean&mdash;that is&mdash;he may
be lost, but he isn't mine," stammered Cordelia, who
was always very literal.</p>

<p>"Then don't blush so, Cordy," bantered Tilly,
wickedly, "else we shall think he is yours."</p>

<p>Cordelia blushed a still deeper pink, but she said
nothing; and in the confusion of leaving the dining-room
she managed to place herself as far from Tilly
as possible. On the back gallery she saw the ranch
foreman. As the others went chattering through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the hall to the gallery beyond, she lingered
timidly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Nolan, would&mdash;would you please tell me
Mr.&mdash;Mr. John's other name?"</p>

<p>"John? Oh, you mean 'Long John,' Miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;'John' what?"</p>

<p>Tim Nolan frowned.</p>

<p>"Why, let me see,"&mdash;he bit his lip in thought&mdash;"'Pierce'&mdash;no,
'Proctor.' Yes, that's it&mdash;'John
Proctor.'"</p>

<p>A look of mingled disappointment and relief
crossed Cordelia's face.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Nolan, very much," she faltered,
as she hurried after her companions.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I'm glad or sorry," she
was thinking. "Of course 'twould have been nice
if he'd been John Sanborn, only I'm afraid Hermit
Joe wouldn't like a cowboy for a son, specially as
there wouldn't be anything for him to do in Sunbridge
at his trade."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy announced soon after supper that
she should take matters in hand very sternly that
night and insist upon an early bedtime hour.</p>

<p>"It has been a long, hot, fatiguing day," she
said, "but you are all so excited you'd sit up half the
night asking questions and telling stories; so I
shall take advantage of my position as chaperon,
and send you to bed very soon."</p>

<p>"O dear!" sighed Tilly. "If only it would come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
morning quick! Just think, we've got to wait a
whole night before we can do any of the things
we're dying to do!"</p>

<p>"Never mind; there are lots of days coming,"
laughed Mr. Hartley. "What a fine family of
young folks I have, to be sure," he gloried, looking
around him contentedly.</p>

<p>They were all about him on the front gallery, in
hammocks and chairs, or sitting on the steps; and
a very attractive group they made, indeed.</p>

<p>"I think it would help the waiting if Genevieve
would go in and sing to us," suggested Bertha, after
a moment's silence. "It will be so heavenly to sit
out here and listen to it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, sing that lovely Mexican 'Swallow Song,'"
coaxed Elsie. "'<i>La Gol&mdash;</i>' <i>&mdash;Gol</i>-something, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Don't swear, Elsie," reproved Tilly, with becoming
dignity.</p>

<p>"<i>'La Golondrina'?</i>" laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a dear," sighed Elsie.</p>

<p>"I'd rather have that Creole Love Song that you
say Mammy Lindy taught you," breathed Cordelia.
"That would be perfect for such a scene as this."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I'd rather have one of those tinkly little
tunes where you can hear the banjos and the tambourines,"
averred Tilly.</p>

<p>"Indeed! At this rate I don't see how I'm going
to sing at all," laughed Genevieve, "with so many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
conflicting wishes. Anything different anybody
wants?"</p>

<p>"Yes," declared Mr. Hartley, promptly. "I
want them all."</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>"All right!" rejoined Genevieve, laughingly,
springing to her feet.</p>

<p>And so while everybody watched the stars in the
far-reaching sky, Genevieve, in the living room,
played and sang till the back gallery and the long
covered way at the rear of the house were full of
the moving shadows of soft-stepping Mexican servants
and cowboys. And everywhere there was the
hush of perfect content while from the living room
there floated out the clear, sweet tones, the weird,
dreamy melodies, and the tinkle of the tambourines.</p>

<p>One by one, an hour later, the lighted windows
in the long, low ranch house became dark. The last
to change was the one behind which sat Cordelia
Wilson in the room she shared with Tilly.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, why don't you put out that light and
go to bed?" demanded Tilly at last, drowsily.
"Morning will never come at this rate!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Tilly, I'm going to bed in just a minute,"
promised Cordelia, as carefully she wrote in the
space opposite Mrs. Miller's name on her list of
"things to do":</p>

<p>"Cowboys are good, kind gentlemen; but they
are noisy, and some rough-looking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>Five minutes later, Cordelia, from her little
bed on one side of the room called a soft
"good night" across to Tilly. But Tilly was already
asleep.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>THE MISTRESS OF THE SIX STAR RANCH</h3>


<p>Breakfast was an early matter at the Six Star
Ranch. It came almost with the sunrise, in fact.
Genevieve had assured her guests, on the night of
their arrival, however, that their breakfast might
be hours later&mdash;that it might, indeed, be at any
hour they pleased. But on this first morning at the
ranch, there was not one guest that did not promptly
respond to the breakfast-bell except Mrs. Kennedy.
The stir of life out of doors had proved an effectual
rising-bell for all; and it was anything but a sleepy-looking
crowd of young people that tripped into the
dining-room to find the boys already waiting for
them&mdash;a little quiet and shy, to be sure, but very
red and shiny-looking as to face and hands, speaking
loudly of a vigorous use of soap and water.</p>

<p>Before the meal was half over, Mrs. Kennedy
came in, only to meet a chorus of remonstrances
that she should have disturbed herself so early.</p>

<p>Genevieve, however, assumed a look of mock
severity.</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia," she began reprovingly in so perfect
an imitation of Miss Jane Chick's severest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
manner that Mrs. Kennedy's lips twitched; "didn't
you hear the rising-bell, my dear? How often must
I ask you not to be late to your meals?"</p>

<p>For one brief moment there was a dazed hush
about the table; then, at sight of Cordelia's horrified
face, Genevieve lost her self-control and giggled.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that was such a good chance," she
chuckled. "Please, Aunt Julia, I just couldn't help
it. I had to!"</p>

<p>"I don't doubt it," smiled back Mrs. Kennedy;
and at the meaning emphasis in her voice there was
a general laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, what shall we do first?" demanded Tilly,
when breakfast was over.</p>

<p>Genevieve put her finger to her lips.</p>

<p>"I wonder, now. Oh, I know! Let's go out
and see if they've driven in the saddle band yet;
then we'll watch the boys rope them and start to
work."</p>

<p>"What's a saddle band?&mdash;sounds like a girth,"
frowned Tilly.</p>

<p>"Humph! I reckon it isn't one, all the same,"
laughed Genevieve. "It's the horses the boys ride.
Each one has his own string, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I don't know," retorted Tilly, aggrievedly.
"And you needn't use all those funny words&mdash;'string'
and 'saddle band' and 'rope them'&mdash;without
explaining them, either, Genevieve Hartley.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
You've been talking like that ever since we came.
Just as if we knew what all that meant!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed again.</p>

<p>"No, you don't, of course," she admitted, "any
more than I understood some of your terms back
East. But come; let's go out and watch the boys.
One of the sheds has a lovely low, flat roof, and we
can see right over into the horse corral from there.
It's easy; there's a ladder. Come on!"</p>

<p>"Why, what a lot of horses!" cried Tilly, a moment
later, as they stepped out of doors. "Do they
ride all those?"</p>

<p>"Not this morning," laughed Genevieve. "You
see, each man has his own string of horses, and he
picks out some one of the bunch, and lets the rest
go. That's Reddy, now, driving them into the corral.
The other boys will be here pretty quick now,
and the fun will begin. You'll see!"</p>

<p>The horse corral was high and circular, and there
was a fine view of it from the shed roof. A snubbing
post was in the middle of the corral, and a
wing was built out at one side from the entrance
gate, so that the horses could be driven in more
easily; yet Reddy quite had his hands full as it was.
At last they were all in, and a merry time they were
having of it, racing in a circle about the enclosure,
heads up, and tails and manes flying.</p>

<p>"Regular merry-go-round, isn't it?" giggled
Tilly. But Cordelia clutched Genevieve's arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Genevieve, look&mdash;they've got ropes! Genevieve,
what <i>are</i> they going to do?" she gasped,
her eyes on the boys who were running from
all directions now, toward the corral. "Why,
Genevieve, they're going <i>in</i> there, with all those
horses!"</p>

<p>"I reckon they are," rejoined the mistress of the
Six Star Ranch. "Now watch, and you'll see.
There!&mdash;see there?&mdash;in the middle by that post!
Each man will pick out one of his own horses and
rope him; then he'll lead him out and saddle him,
and the deed's done."</p>

<p>"I guess that's easier to say than to do," observed
Bertha, dryly. "I notice there aren't any
of those horses just hanging 'round waiting to be
caught!"</p>

<p>"No, there aren't, to-day," laughed Genevieve;
"though some of the horses will do just that, at
times&mdash;specially Long John's. They're pretty
lively now, however, and it <i>does</i> take some skill to
make a nice job of it when they're jamming and
jostling like that. But the boys are equal to it.
We've got some splendid ropers!" This time there
was a note of very evident pride in the voice of the
mistress of the Six Star Ranch.</p>

<p>It was a brief but exciting time that followed,
filled, as it was, with the shouts of the boys&mdash;the
jeers at some failure, the cheers at some success&mdash;the
thud of the horses' hoofs, the swirl of the skillfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
flung ropes. It was almost as exciting when
the boys, their horses once caught, led out, and saddled,
rode off for their morning's work. To Cordelia,
especially, it was an experience never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>"Going to turn cowboy, Miss Cordelia?" asked
Mr. Hartley, with a smile, as he met the girl coming
into the house a little later. Mr. Hartley, in
his broad-brimmed hat, and his gray tweed trousers
tucked into his high boots, looked the picture of the
prosperous ranchman at home.</p>

<p>Cordelia showed a distinctly shocked face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Don't think you could learn to swing the rope&mdash;eh?"
he teased.</p>

<p>"Mercy, no!"</p>

<p>A half-proud, wholly-gratified smile crossed the
man's face.</p>

<p>"It isn't as easy as it looks to be," he said.
"Once in a while we get a tenderfoot out here,
though, who thinks he's going to learn it all in a
minute&mdash;or, rather, do it without any learning.
But to be a good roper, one has to give it long, hard
practice. The best of 'em begin young. Reddy, the
crack roper in my outfit, tells me he began with his
mother's clothes-line at the age of four years, with
his rocking-horse for a victim. It seems there was
a picture in one of his books of a cowboy roping a
pony, and&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Hartley stopped, as if listening. From the
rear of the house had sounded the creak of the
windmill crank. The man turned, entered the hall,
and crossed to the window. Then he shook his
head with a smile.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Genevieve is up to her old tricks,"
he said. "She's stopping the windmill so she can
climb to the top of the tower, I reckon."</p>

<p>"Genevieve!&mdash;at the top of that tower!" exclaimed
Cordelia.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley's lips twitched.</p>

<p>"Yes. That used to be a daily stunt of hers, and&mdash;I
let her," added the man, a little doggedly. "It
made her well and strong, anyhow, and helped to
develop her muscle. You see, we&mdash;we don't have
gymnasiums on the ranch," he concluded whimsically,
as they stepped together out on to the back
gallery.</p>

<p>A babel of gleeful shouts and laughter greeted
their ears. A moment later Mr. Hartley and Cordelia
came in sight of the windmill. At its base
four chattering, shrieking girls were laughing and
clapping their hands. Above their heads, Genevieve,
in a dark blue gymnasium suit, was swinging
herself gracefully from cross-piece to cross-piece in
the tower.</p>

<p>"You see," smiled Mr. Hartley; but he was interrupted
by a shocked, frightened voice behind
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Genevieve, my dear!" gasped Mrs. Kennedy,
hurrying forward.</p>

<p>Genevieve did not hear, apparently. To the girls
she waved a free hand, joyously. She was almost
at the top.</p>

<p>"It's fine&mdash;mighty fine up here," she caroled.
"I can see 'way, 'way over the prairie!"</p>

<p>"Genevieve! Genevieve Hartley, come down this
instant," commanded Mrs. Kennedy. Then her
voice shook, and grew piteously frightened, as she
stammered: "No, no&mdash;don't come down, dear!
Genevieve, how <i>can</i> you come down?" Mrs. Kennedy
was wringing her hands now.</p>

<p>This time Genevieve heard.</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Julia, what is it? What is the matter?"
The girl's voice expressed only concerned
surprise.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" echoed Mrs. Kennedy,
faintly. "Genevieve, how can you come
down?"</p>

<p>"Come down? Why, that's easy! But I don't
want to come down."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy's lips grew stern.</p>

<p>"Genevieve," she said, with an obvious effort to
speak quietly; "if you can come down, I desire you
to do so at once."</p>

<p>Genevieve came down. Her eyes flashed a little,
and her cheeks were redder than usual. She did not
once glance toward the girls, clustered in a silent,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
frightened little group. She did not appear to notice
even her father, standing by. She went straight
to Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>"I've come down, Aunt Julia."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy had been seriously disturbed, and
genuinely frightened. To her, Genevieve's climb
to the top of the windmill tower was very dangerous,
as well as very unladylike. Yet it was the
fright, even more than the displeasure that made
her voice sound so cold now in her effort to steady
it.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Genevieve. Please see that there
is no occasion for you to <i>come down</i> again," she said
meaningly. Then she turned and went into the
house.</p>

<p>Just how it happened, Genevieve did not know,
but almost at once she found herself alone with her
father on the back gallery. The girls had disappeared.</p>

<p>Genevieve was very angry now.</p>

<p>"Father, it wasn't fair, to speak like that," she
choked, "before the girls and you, when I hadn't
done a thing&mdash;not a thing! Why, it&mdash;it was just
like Miss Jane! I never knew Aunt Julia to be like
that."</p>

<p>For a moment her father was silent. His face
wore a thoughtful frown.</p>

<p>"I know it, dearie," he said at last. "But I don't
think Mrs. Kennedy quite realized, quite understood&mdash;how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<i>you'd</i> feel. She didn't think it just
right for you to be there."</p>

<p>"But I was in my gym suit, Father. I skipped in
and put it on purposely, while the others were doing
something else; then I climbed the tower. I'd
planned 'way ahead how I'd surprise them."</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>"I know, dearie," he nodded, after a moment;
"but I reckon it was just a little too much of a
surprise for Mrs. Kennedy. You know she isn't
used to the West; and&mdash;do Boston young ladies
climb windmill towers?"</p>

<p>In spite of her anger, Genevieve laughed. The
mention of Boston had put her in mind of some
Boston friends of Mrs. Kennedy's, whom she knew.
She had a sudden vision of what Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Butterfield's faces would have been, had
their stern, sixty-year-old eyes seen what Mrs.
Kennedy saw.</p>

<p>"I reckon, too," went on Mr. Hartley, with a
sigh, "that I have sort of spoiled you, letting you
have your own way. And maybe Mammy Lindy
and I, in our anxiety that you should be well and
strong, and sit the saddle like a Texas daughter
should, haven't taught you always just the dainty
little lady ways&mdash;that you ought to have been
taught."</p>

<p>"You've taught me everything&mdash;everything
good and lovely," protested the girl, hotly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook his head. A far-away look came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I haven't, dearie&mdash;and that's why I sent you
East."</p>

<p>Genevieve flushed.</p>

<p>"But I didn't want to go East, in the first place,"
she stormed. "I wanted to stay here with you.
Besides, Aunt Julia isn't really any relation,&mdash;nor
Miss Jane, either. They haven't any right to&mdash;to
speak to me like that."</p>

<p>A dull red stole to John Hartley's cheek.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, dearie," he demurred, with a shake
of the head. "You mustn't forget how good they've
been to you. Besides&mdash;they have got the right. I
gave it to them. I told them to make you like
themselves."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Genevieve's eyes were
moodily fixed on the floor. Her father gave her a
swift glance, then went on, softly:</p>

<p>"I suspect, too, maybe we're both forgetting,
dearie. After all, Mrs. Kennedy did it every bit
through&mdash;love. She was frightened. She was so
scared she just shook, dearie."</p>

<p>"She&mdash;was?" Genevieve's voice was amazed.</p>

<p>"Yes. I reckon that's more than half why she
spoke so stern, and why she's in her room crying
this minute&mdash;as I'll warrant she is. I saw her eyes,
and I saw how her hands shook. And I saw it was
all she could do to keep from falling right on your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
neck&mdash;because she had you back safe and sound.
Maybe you didn't see that, dearie."</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"You see, their <i>ways</i> back East, and ours, aren't
alike," resumed the man, after a time; "but I reckon
their&mdash;<i>love</i> is."</p>

<p>Genevieve drew a long breath. Her brown eyes
were not clear.</p>

<p>"I reckon maybe I'll go and find&mdash;Aunt Julia,"
she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>The next moment her father sat alone on the back
gallery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>REDDY AND THE BRONCHO</h3>


<p>There was no lack of interesting things to do
that first day at the ranch. There was one half-hour,
to be sure, when five of the Happy Hexagons
sat a little quietly on the front gallery and tried to
talk as if there were no such thing as a windmill,
and no such person as a girl who could climb to the
top of it; but after Genevieve and Mrs. Kennedy,
arm in arm, came through the front door&mdash;with eyes
indeed, a little misty, but with lips cheerfully
smiling&mdash;every vestige of constraint fled. Genevieve,
once more in her pretty linen frock, was again
the alert little hostess, and very soon they were all
off to inspect the flower garden, the vegetable garden,
the cow corral, the sheds, the stables, and the
blacksmith's shop, not forgetting Teresa, the cook,
who was making tamales in the kitchen for them,
nor Pepito, Genevieve's own horse that she rode
before she went East.</p>

<p>"And we'll have the boys pick out some horses
for you, too," cried Genevieve, smoothing Pepito's
sleek coat in response to his welcoming whinny of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
delight. "I'm sure they can find something all
right for us."</p>

<p>Tilly's eyes brightened, so, too, did Bertha's;
but Cordelia spoke hastily, her eyes bent a bit distrustfully
on the spirited little horse Genevieve was
petting.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I don't believe they'll have time to hunt
up horses for us, Genevieve. Really, I don't think
we ought to ask them to."</p>

<p>"Maybe we won't, then&mdash;for <i>you</i>," teased Tilly,
saucily. "We'll just let them take time for ours."</p>

<p>It is a question, however, if that afternoon, even
Tilly wanted to ride; for, according to Cordelia's
notes that night in "Things to do," they saw a
broncho "bursted."</p>

<p>It was Mr. Tim who had said at the dinner table
that noon:</p>

<p>"If you young people happen to be on hand, say
at about four o'clock, you'll see something doing.
Reddy's got a horse or two he's going to put
through their paces&mdash;and one of 'em's never been
saddled."</p>

<p>Privately, to Mr. Hartley, Mrs. Kennedy objected
a little.</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Mr. Hartley, the girls ought to
witness such a sight?" she asked uneasily. "Of
course I don't want to be too strict in my demands,"
she went on with a little twinkle in her eyes that
Mr. Hartley thoroughly understood. "I realize the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
West isn't the East. But, will this be&mdash;all
right?"</p>

<p>"I think it will&mdash;even in your judgment," he
assured her. "It's no professional broncho-buster
that they'll see to-day. I seldom hire them, anyway,
as I prefer to have our own men break in the
horses&mdash;specially as we're lucky enough to have
three or four mighty skillful ones right in our own
outfit. There'll be nothing brutal or rough to-day,
Mrs. Kennedy. Only one beast is entirely wild, and
he's not really vicious, Reddy says. Genevieve tells
me the girls have heard a lot about broncho-busting,
and that they're wild to see it. They wouldn't think
they'd been to Texas, I'm afraid, if they didn't see
something of the sort."</p>

<p>"Very well," agreed Mrs. Kennedy, with visible
reluctance.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," went on Mr. Hartley, his eyes
twinkling, "you mustn't expect that they'll see exactly
a pony parade drawing baby carriages down
Beacon Street; but they will see some of the best
horsemanship that the state of Texas can show. I
take it you never saw a little beast whose chief aim
in life was to get clear of his rider&mdash;eh, Mrs. Kennedy?"</p>

<p>"No, I never did," shuddered the lady; "and I'm
not sure that I'd want to," she finished decisively,
as she turned away.</p>

<p>The new horse proved to be a fiery little bay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
mustang, and the fight began from the first moment
that the noose settled about his untamed little neck.
As Tilly told of the affair in the Chronicles of the
Hexagon Club, it was like this:</p>

<p>"We saw a broncho busted this afternoon.
Reddy busted it, and he was splendid. Mercy! I
shall never think anything my old Beauty does is
bad again. Beauty is a snail and a saint beside this
jumping, plunging, squealing creature that never by
any chance was on his feet properly&mdash;except when
he came down hard on all four of them at once with
his back humped right up in the middle in a perfectly
frightful fashion&mdash;and I suppose that wasn't
'properly.' Anyhow, I shouldn't have thought it
was, if I had had to try to sit on that hump!</p>

<p>"But that wasn't the only thing that he did.
Dear me, no! He danced, and rolled, and seesawed
up and down&mdash;'pitching,' Mr. Hartley called it.
And I'm sure it looked like it. First he'd try standing
on his two fore feet, then he'd give them a rest,
and take the other two. And sometimes he couldn't
seem to make up his mind which he wanted to use,
or which way he wanted to turn, and he'd change
about right up in the air so he'd come down facing
the other way. My, he was the most uncertain
creature!</p>

<p>"It didn't seem to make a mite of difference
where the horse was, or what he did with his feet,
though. Reddy was right there every time, and all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
<i>ready</i>, too. (Yes, I know a pun is the lowest order
of wit. But I don't care. I couldn't help it, anyway&mdash;it
was such a <i>ready</i> one!) There he sat, so
loose and easy, too, with his quirt (that's a whip),
and it looked sometimes just as if he wasn't half
trying&mdash;that he didn't need to. But I'm sure he
was trying. Anyhow, I know I couldn't have stayed
on that horse five minutes; and I don't believe even
Genevieve could. (I said that to Mr. Tim Nolan,
and he laughed so hard I thought I'd put it in here,
and let somebody else laugh.)</p>

<p>"Of course every one of us was awfully excited,
and the boys kept shouting and cheering, and yelling
'Stay with him!' and telling him not to 'go to
leather'&mdash;whatever that may mean! And Reddy
did stay. He stayed till the little horse got tired
out; then he got off, and led the horse away, and
some of the other boys went through a good deal
the same sort of thing with other horses, only these
had all been partly broken before, they told us. But,
mercy, they were bad enough, anyhow, I thought,
to have been brand-new. Reddy did another one,
too, and this time he put silver half-dollars under
his feet in the stirrups: And when the little beast&mdash;the
horse, I mean, not Reddy&mdash;got through his
antics, there the half-dollars were, still there in the
same old place. How the boys did yell and cheer
then!</p>

<p>"After that, they all just 'showed off' for us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
throwing their ropes over anything and everything,
and playing like a crowd of little boys on a picnic,
only Mr. Hartley said they were doing some
'mighty fine roping' with it all. Their ropes are
mostly about forty feet long, and it looked as if they
just slung them any old way; but I know they don't,
for afterward, just before we went in to supper,
Reddy let me take his rope, and I tried to throw
it. I aimed for a post a little way ahead of me,
but I got Pedro, the Mexican cowboy, behind
me, right 'in the neck,' as Mr. Tim said. Pedro
grinned, and of course everybody else laughed
horribly.</p>

<p>"And thus endeth the account of how the
bronchos were busted. (P.S. I hope whoever
reads the above will own up that for once Tilly
Mack got some sense into her part. So there!) I
forgot to say we took a nap after dinner. Everybody
does here. 'Siestas' they call them, Genevieve
says."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was after supper that Genevieve said:</p>

<p>"Now let's go out on to the front gallery and
watch the sunset. Supper was too late last night
for us to see much of it, but to-night it will be fine&mdash;and
you've no idea what a sunset really can be
until you've seen it on the prairie!"</p>

<p>Tilly pursed her lips.</p>

<p>"There, Genevieve Hartley, there's another of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
those mysterious words of yours; and it isn't the
first time I've heard it here, either."</p>

<p>"What word?"</p>

<p>"'Gallery.' What is a gallery? I'm sure I don't
see what there can be about a one-story house to be
called a 'gallery'!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed.</p>

<p>"You call them 'verandas' or 'piazzas,' back
East, Tilly. We call them 'galleries' in Texas."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it?" frowned Tilly. "But you
never called Sunbridge piazzas that."</p>

<p>Genevieve shook her head.</p>

<p>"No; it's only when I get back here that the
old names come back to me so naturally. Besides&mdash;when
I was East, I very soon found out what
you called them; so I called them that, too."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," retorted Tilly, saucily, "I've
got my opinion of folks that will call a one-story
piazza a 'gallery.' I should just like to show them
what we call a 'gallery' at home&mdash;say, the top
one in the Boston Theater, you know, where it runs
'way back."</p>

<p>Genevieve only laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>On the front gallery all settled themselves comfortably
to watch the sunset. Already the sun was
low in the west, a huge ball of fire just ready to
drop into the sea of prairie grass.</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem nearly so hot here as I thought
it would," observed Bertha, after a time. "Oh, it's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
been warm to-day, of course&mdash;part of the time
awfully warm," she added hastily. "But I've been
just as hot in New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"We think we've got a mighty fine climate,"
spoke up Mr. Hartley. "Now, last year, you in the
East, had heaps of prostrations from the heat.
Texas had just three."</p>

<p>"I suppose that was owing to the Northers,"
murmured Cordelia, interestedly. "Now, feel it!"
She put up her hand. "There's a breeze, now. Is
that a Norther?"</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley coughed suddenly. Genevieve
stared.</p>

<p>"What do you know about Northers?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I read about them. It said you&mdash;you
had them."</p>

<p>Genevieve broke into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>"I should think, by the way you put it, that they
were the measles or the whooping cough! We do
have them, Cordelia&mdash;in the winter, specially, but
not so often in July. Besides, they don't feel much
like this little breeze&mdash;as you'd soon find out, if
you happened to be in one."</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence; then Genevieve
spoke again.</p>

<p>"See here, where'd you find out all these things
about Texas&mdash;that we didn't have butter, and did
have Northers?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Cordelia could answer, Tilly interposed
with a chuckling laugh:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Genevieve, just where they found
out," she cut in, utterly ignoring her own share of
the "they." "Now, listen! How do you suppose
they spent all the time you were in New Jersey?
I'll tell you. They were digging up Texas every
single minute; and they dug, and dug, and dug,
until there wasn't a mean annual temperature, or a
mean anything else that they didn't drag from its
hiding-place and hold up triumphantly, and shout:
'Behold, this is Texas!'"</p>

<p>"Girls&mdash;you didn't!" cried Genevieve, choking
with laughter.</p>

<p>"They did!" affirmed Tilly.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>we</i> did&mdash;including Tilly," declared Cordelia,
with unexpected spirit.</p>

<p>Everybody laughed this time, but it was Alma,
the peacemaker, who spoke next.</p>

<p>"Oh, look&mdash;look at the sun!" she exclaimed.
"Aren't those rose-pink clouds gorgeous?"</p>

<p>"My, wouldn't they make a lovely dress?"
sighed Elsie.</p>

<p>"Yes, and see the golden pathway the sun has
made, straight down to the prairie," cried Bertha
Brown.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, look, Mr. Hartley! Is that grass on
fire?" gasped Cordelia.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley shook his head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"No&mdash;I hope not."</p>

<p>"But you do have prairie fires?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes; but not so often nowadays&mdash;though
I've seen some bad ones, in my time."</p>

<p>There was a long silence. All eyes were turned
toward the west. Above, a riot of rose and gold
and purple flamed across the sky. Below, more
softly, the colors seemed almost repeated in the
waving, shifting, changing expanse of fairylike loveliness
that the prairie had become.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful it all is, and how I do love
it," breathed Genevieve, after a time, as if to herself.</p>

<p>Gradually the gorgeous rose and gold and purple
changed, softened, and faded quite away. The
slender crescent of the moon appeared, and one by
one the stars showed in the darkening sky.</p>

<p>"It's all so quiet, so wonderfully quiet," sighed
Cordelia; then, abruptly, she cried: "Why, what's
that?"</p>

<p>There had sounded a far-away shout, then another,
nearer. On the breeze was borne the muffled
tread of hundreds of hoofs. A dog began to bark
lustily.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Later, they swept into view&mdash;a troop of cowboys,
and a thronging, jostling mass of cattle.</p>

<p>"On the way to a round-up, probably," explained
Mr. Hartley, as he rose to his feet and went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to meet the foreman, who was coming toward the
house.</p>

<p>Still later, he explained more fully.</p>

<p>"They've put them in our pens for the night.
The boys have gone into camp a mile or so away."</p>

<p>Genevieve shuddered.</p>

<p>"I hate round-ups," she cried passionately.</p>

<p>"What are round-ups?" asked Bertha Brown.</p>

<p>"Where they brand the cattle," answered Genevieve,
quickly, but in a low voice.</p>

<p>Cordelia, who was near her, shuddered. She
seemed now to see before her eyes that seething
mass of heads and horns, sweeping on and on unceasingly.</p>

<p>Cordelia had two dreams that night. She wondered,
afterward, which was the worse. She
dreamed, first, that an endless stream of cattle
climbed the windmill tower and jumped clear to the
edge of the prairie, where the sun went down. She
dreamed, secondly, that she was very hungry, and
that twenty feet away stood a table laden with hot
biscuits and fried chicken; but that the only way
she could obtain any food was to "rope it" with
Reddy's lariat. At the time of waking up she had
not obtained so much as one biscuit or a chicken
wing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>CORDELIA GOES TO CHURCH</h3>


<p>"We're going to have church to-morrow," Genevieve
had announced on the first Saturday night at
the ranch. "A minister is coming from Bolo, and
he holds the service out of doors. Everybody on
the place comes, and we sing, and it's lovely!"</p>

<p>As it happened, Cordelia had not been present
when Genevieve made this announcement. It was
left for Tilly, therefore, to tell her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cordelia, I forgot. We're going to have
church to-morrow," she said that night, as she was
brushing her hair in their room.</p>

<p>Cordelia, who was taking off her shoes, looked
up delightedly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tilly&mdash;church? We're going to church?"</p>

<p>Tilly laughed; then an odd little twist came to
her mouth.</p>

<p>"Yes, Cordelia; we're&mdash;going to church," she
answered.</p>

<p>"What time?"</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock, Genevieve said."</p>

<p>"Oh, won't that be fun&mdash;I mean, I'm very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
glad," corrected Cordelia, hastily, a confused red in
her cheeks.</p>

<p>In Cordelia's bed that night, Cordelia thought
happily:</p>

<p>"Maybe now I can get some new ideas for Uncle
Thomas to put in his services. They do everything
so differently here in the West, and Uncle's audiences
get so small sometimes, specially Sunday evenings."</p>

<p>In Tilly's bed, Tilly, a little guilty as to conscience,
was trying to excuse herself.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," she was arguing mentally,
"Genevieve said 'everybody comes,' and if they
'come' they must 'go'; so of course we're 'going'
to church."</p>

<p>Not until Cordelia was dropping off to sleep did
something occur to her. She sat up, then, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Tilly," she called softly, "where is that church?
Do we have to ride eighteen miles to Bolo?"</p>

<p>Tilly did not answer. She was asleep, decided
Cordelia&mdash;it was dark, and Cordelia could not see
the pillow Tilly was stuffing into her mouth.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Just after breakfast Sunday morning, Elsie Martin
said a low word in Genevieve's ear, and drew
her out of earshot of the others. Her eyes were
anxious.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, do you have to dress up much for
this kind of&mdash;of church?" she questioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a bit, dear. Don't worry. Anything you
have will be lovely."</p>

<p>"I know; but&mdash;well, you see, it's just this," she
quavered. "Aunt Kate fixed up the girls' green
chambray for me just before we came. I saw then
it didn't look just right, but we were in such an
awful hurry there wasn't time to do anything; and
I was so excited, anyway, that I didn't seem to
mind, much. But out here, in the bright light, it
looks awfully!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! That's all your own notion, Elsie,"
rejoined Genevieve, comfortingly. "I'm sure it
looks lovely. Anyhow, it wouldn't matter if it
didn't&mdash;here."</p>

<p>Elsie shook her head despondently.</p>

<p>"But you don't understand," she said. "You
know the twins dress alike, and this was their green
chambray. Aunt Kate always likes to use their
things, she says, because there's always double quantity;
but this time it didn't work so well. You see,
Cora was sick a lot last summer, when they had this
dress, and she didn't wear hers half so much as
Clara did, so hers wasn't faded hardly any. It was
an awful funny color to begin with; but it's worse
now, with part of it one shade, and part another.
You see, one sleeve's made of Cora's, and one of
Clara's; and the front breadth is Cora's and the
back is Clara's. Of course Aunt Kate cut it out
where she could do it best, and didn't think but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
what they were alike; but you don't know what a
funny-looking thing that dress is! I&mdash;I don't
know whether to turn Clara toward folks, or Cora,"
she finished with a little laugh.</p>

<p>Genevieve heard the laugh&mdash;but she saw that it
came through trembling lips.</p>

<p>"Well, I just wouldn't fret," she declared, with
an affectionate little hug. "If you don't want to
wear it, wear something else. What a nuisance
clothes are, anyhow! I've always said I wished we
didn't have to change our dress every time we
turned around!"</p>

<p>Elsie's eyes became wistful. She shook her head
sadly.</p>

<p>"You don't know anything about it, Genevieve.
Your clothes <i>haven't</i> been a nuisance to you&mdash;even
if you think they have. You see, you don't realize
how nice it is to have such a lot of pretty things&mdash;and
all new," she sighed as she turned away.</p>

<p>When Genevieve went to her room to dress for
"church" that morning, she looked a little thoughtfully
at the array of pretty frocks hanging in her
closet.</p>

<p>"I wish I could give some to Elsie," she sighed;
"but Elsie isn't poor, of course, and I suppose
she&mdash;she wouldn't take them. But I suspect I don't
half appreciate them myself&mdash;just as Elsie said,"
she finished, as she took down a fresh, white linen.</p>

<p>At quarter before eleven Cordelia Wilson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
knocked at Genevieve's door. Genevieve opened it
to find Cordelia in a neat jacket suit, hat on, and
gloves in hand.</p>

<p>"Am I all right, Genevieve?" she asked. "I
wasn't quite sure just what to wear."</p>

<p>"Why, y-yes&mdash;only you don't need the hat, nor
the gloves, dear; and I shouldn't think you'd want
that coat, it's so warm!"</p>

<p>"Not want a hat, or gloves," burst out Cordelia,
looking distinctly shocked. "Why, Genevieve Hartley!
I know you do very strange things here in
the West, but I did suppose you&mdash;you dressed
properly to go to church!"</p>

<p>"But it isn't really church, Cordelia," smiled
Genevieve. "I only call it so, you know. And of
course we don't 'go' at all&mdash;only as far as the
back gallery."</p>

<p>Cordelia stared, frowningly.</p>

<p>"You mean you don't drive off&mdash;anywhere?"
she demanded. "That you have a service right
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought you knew."</p>

<p>"But Tilly said&mdash;why, I don't know what she
did say, exactly, but she let me think we were going
to drive off somewhere. And look at me&mdash;rigged
out like this! You know how she'll tease me!"
There were almost tears in Cordelia's sensitive eyes.</p>

<p>"Has she seen you&mdash;in this?"</p>

<p>"No; but she will when I go back. I saw her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
whisk through the hall to our room just as I crossed
through to come in here."</p>

<p>"Then we won't let her see you," chuckled Genevieve.
"Here, let's have your hat and gloves and
coat. I'll hide them in my closet. You can get
them later when Tilly isn't around. Now run back
and put a serene face on it. Just don't let her suspect
you ever thought of your hat and gloves."</p>

<p>"But, do you think I ought to do&mdash;that? Won't
it be&mdash;deceit?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, it won't," declared Genevieve, emphatically;
"not any sort of deceit that's any harm.
It will just be depriving Miss Tilly of the naughty
fun she expected to have with you. You <i>know</i> how
Tilly loves to tease folks. Well, she'll just find the
tables turned, this time. Now run back quick, or
she'll suspect things!" And, a little doubtfully,
Cordelia went.</p>

<p>As she had expected, she found Tilly in their
room.</p>

<p>"Why don't you get ready for church, Cordy?"
demanded Tilly, promptly.</p>

<p>"I am ready. I dressed early, before you came
in," returned Cordelia, trying to speak very unconcernedly.
"Why? Don't you think this will do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, of course. You look very nice," murmured
Tilly, a little hastily, sending a furtive glance
into Cordelia's face. There was nothing, apparently,
about Cordelia to indicate that anything unexpected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
had occurred, or was about to occur; and she herself
could not, of course, ask why no preparations
for an eighteen-mile journey were being made, specially
when she had pretended to be asleep the night
before when Cordelia asked her question about that
same journey. "You look very nice, I'm sure,"
murmured Tilly, again. And Cordelia, hearing the
vague disappointment in Tilly's voice, was filled
with joy&mdash;that yet carried a pang of remorse.</p>

<p>It was a little later, just as Tilly was leaving the
room, that Cordelia turned abruptly.</p>

<p>"Tilly, I did have on my hat and coat," she burst
out hurriedly. "I did think we were going to drive
'way off somewhere to church. But I found out and
hid them in Genevieve's room, so you would not
know and&mdash;and tease me," she finished breathlessly.</p>

<p>Tilly turned back with a laugh.</p>

<p>"You little rogue!" she began; then she stopped
short. Her face changed. "But&mdash;why in the
world did you tell me now?" she demanded curiously.</p>

<p>"I thought I ought to."</p>

<p>"Ought to!&mdash;ought to let me tease you!"
echoed the dumfounded Tilly.</p>

<p>Cordelia stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"Not that, of course, exactly," she stammered.
"It's only that&mdash;that it seemed somehow like&mdash;deceiving
you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment Tilly stared; then, suddenly, she
darted across the room and put both arms around
the minister's niece. Cordelia was not quite sure
whether she was hugging her, or shaking her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you&mdash;you&mdash;I don't know <i>what</i> you are!"
Tilly was exclaiming. "But you're a dear, anyhow!"
And it was actually a sob that the astounded
Cordelia heard as Tilly turned and fled
from the room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To Sunbridge eyes, "church" that morning was
something very new and novel. At eleven o'clock
Genevieve and her father piloted their guests to the
back gallery where seats had been reserved for
them. The minister, a dark-haired, tired-looking
man with kind eyes, had arrived some time before
on horseback. To Mrs. Kennedy, especially, he
looked a little too unconventional in his heavy boots
and coarse garments which, though plainly recently
brushed, still showed the dust of the prairie in spots.
He sat now at one side talking with Mr. Tim while
his "congregation" was gathering.</p>

<p>And what a congregation it was! As Genevieve
had said, everybody on the ranch came, except those
whose duties prohibited them from coming. Singly,
or in picturesque groups, they settled themselves
comfortably on the back gallery, or along the covered
way leading to the dining-room. Even Teresa,
in a huge fresh apron that made her great bulk look<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
even greater, sat just outside the dining-room door,
where she could easily run in from time to time, to
see that the roast chickens in the oven were not
burning, nor the beets on the stove boiling dry.</p>

<p>The "pulpit" was a little stand placed at the
house-end of the covered way. The "choir" was
the piano in the living-room drawn up close to the
window, with Genevieve herself seated at it. Nor
was the "church" itself devoid of beauty, with its
growing vines and flowers, and its shifting lights
and shadows as the soft clouds sailed slowly through
the blue sky overhead. As to the audience&mdash;no
scholarly orator in a Fifth Avenue cathedral found
that day more attentive listeners than did that tired-looking
minister find in the curiously-assorted
groups before him&mdash;the swarthy Mexicans, the
picturesque cowboys, the eager-eyed, fresh-faced
young girls from a far-away town in the East.</p>

<p>They sang first, Genevieve's own clear voice
leading; and even Tilly, who seldom sang in church
at home, found herself joining heartily in "Nearer
my God to Thee," and "Bringing in the Sheaves."
There was something so free, so whole-souled about
the music in that soft outdoor air, that she, as well
as some of the others, decided that never before
had any music sounded so inspiring.</p>

<p>For the first two minutes after the preacher arose
to begin his sermon, Mrs. Kennedy saw nothing
but the dust on the right shoulder of his coat. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
after that she saw nothing but his earnest eyes.
She had fallen then quite under the sway of his
clear, ringing voice.</p>

<p>"'While Josiah was yet young, in the sixteenth
year of his age, he began to seek the God of his
fathers,'" announced the clear, ringing voice as
the text; and Genevieve, hearing it, wondered if
the minister could have known that at least a part
of his audience that day would be so exactly, or so
very nearly, "in the sixteenth year" of their own
age.</p>

<p>It was a good sermon, and it was well preached.
The time, the place, the occasion, the atmosphere
all helped, too. All the Happy Hexagons paid
reverent attention. Tilly, fresh from her somewhat
amazing experience with Cordelia, made many and
stern resolutions to be everything that was good
and helpful, nothing that was bad and hateful.
Genevieve, who had slipped off her piano stool to
an easier chair, sat with dreamy, tender eyes. She
was thinking of the dear mother, who, as she could
so well remember, had told her that she must always
be good and brave and true first, before anything
else.</p>

<p>"Good and brave and true!" She wondered if
she could&mdash;always. It seemed so easy to do it now,
with this good man's earnest voice in her ears. But
it was so hard, so strangely hard, at other times.
And there were so many things&mdash;so many, many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<i>little</i> things&mdash;that to Aunt Julia and Miss Jane
looked so big!&mdash;things, too, that to her seemed
eminently all right.</p>

<p>"'When Josiah was yet young, in the sixteenth
year of his age, he began to seek the God of his
fathers,'" quoted the minister again, impressively;
and Genevieve realized then, with misty eyes, that
the sermon was done.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The minister stayed to dinner, of course; and,
in spite of her interest in the sermon, Teresa had
seen to it that the dinner was everything that one
could ask of it. The minister had the place of
honor at the table, and proved to be a most agreeable
talker. Genevieve had not caught his name
distinctly, but she thought it was "Jones." He
lived in Bolo, he said, having recently moved there
from a distant part of the state. He hoped that he
might be able to do good work there. Certainly
there was need that somebody do something. In
response to Mr. Hartley's cordial invitation to stay
a few days at the ranch, he answered with visible
regret:</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. Nothing would please me
more, but it is quite out of the question. I must go
back this afternoon. I have a service in Bolo this
evening."</p>

<p>"You must be a busy man," observed Mr. Hartley,
genially.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The minister sighed.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;yet I can't do half that I want to. This
outside work among the ranches I shall try to carry
on as best I can. But you're all so afraid you'll have
a neighbor nearer than a score of miles," he added
with a whimsical smile, "that I can't get among you
very often."</p>

<p>It was after dinner that the minister chanced to
hear Genevieve speak of herself as a Happy Hexagon.</p>

<p>"Hexagon?&mdash;Hexagon?" he echoed smilingly.
"And are you, too, a Happy Hexagon?" he asked,
turning to the mistress of the Six Star Ranch.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. Do you mean you know another
one?" questioned the girl, all interest immediately.
"It's the name of our girls' club&mdash;the Hexagon
Club."</p>

<p>"No, but I heard of one, once," rejoined the man.
"And it isn't usual, you know, so it attracted my
attention."</p>

<p>"But where was it? When was it? We supposed
we were the only Happy Hexagons in the
world," cried Genevieve.</p>

<p>The minister smiled.</p>

<p>"I found my Happy Hexagons at the bottom of
a letter from the East."</p>

<p>"A letter from the East?" Genevieve's voice
held now a curious note of wild unbelief.</p>

<p>"Yes. It came before we moved to Bolo. My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
elder daughter was teaching in the East, and was
taken ill. Some of her girls wrote to us."</p>

<p>Genevieve sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;you can't be&mdash;the Rev. Luke
Jones!" she cried.</p>

<p>"That is my name."</p>

<p>"And is Quentina your daughter?"</p>

<p>It was the minister's turn to look amazed.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; but&mdash;how do you know? Are you&mdash;you
can't be&mdash;<i>my</i> Happy Hexagons!" he ejaculated.</p>

<p>She nodded laughingly. She spoke, too; but
what she said was not heard. All of the Happy
Hexagons were talking by that time. The Rev. Mr.
Jones, indeed, found himself besieged on all sides
with eager questions and amazed comments.</p>

<p>Under cover of the confusion, Mr. Hartley turned
in puzzled wonder to Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> you tell me what all this is about?" he
begged.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy smiled.</p>

<p>"Of course! I think perhaps it is all new to you.
Last winter Miss Alice Jones, a Texas lady and the
girls' Latin teacher, was taken ill. The girls were
very attentive, and did lots of little things for her;
but she grew worse and had to leave. Just before
she went, the mother wrote a letter thanking the
girls, and in the letter was a note signed 'Quentina
Jones.' Quentina was a younger sister, it seemed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and she, too, wished to thank the girls. Of course
the girls were delighted, and immediately answered
it, signing themselves 'The Happy Hexagons.' The
teacher went away then, and the girls heard nothing
more. But they have talked of Quentina Jones
ever since."</p>

<p>"But it's all so wonderful," cried Genevieve, her
voice rising dominant at last. "Where is Miss
Alice Jones, and how is she?"</p>

<p>"She is better, thank you, though not very strong
yet. She is teaching in Colorado."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so glad," cried Genevieve, "but I wish
we could see her, too. Only think, girls, of Quentina
Jones being right here, only eighteen miles
away!"</p>

<p>"One would think eighteen miles were a mere
step!" laughed Tilly.</p>

<p>"They are&mdash;in Texas," retorted Genevieve.
Then, to the minister she said: "Now tell us, please,
Mr. Jones, what we can do. We want to see Quentina
right away, quick. We can't wait! Can
she come over? <i>Can't</i> she? We'd love to have
her!"</p>

<p>The minister shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, Miss Genevieve&mdash;thank you
just the same. I'd love to have her. It would do
her such a world of good, poor little girl, to have
one happy time with all you young people! But my
wife has a lame foot just now, and Quentina simply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
cannot be spared. You know she has several
brothers, so we have quite a family. But, I'll tell
you what&mdash;you young ladies must all come to see
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! We'd love to&mdash;and we will,
too." (Back in her ranch home, it was easy for
Genevieve to slip into her old independent way of
consulting no one's will but her own.) "When do
you want us?"</p>

<p>"But, my dear," interposed Mrs. Kennedy,
hastily, "if Mrs. Jones is not well, surely we cannot
ask her to take in six noisy girls as guests!"</p>

<p>"Why, no&mdash;of course not," stammered Genevieve.
The rest of the Happy Hexagons looked
suddenly heartbroken. But the minister smiled reassuringly.</p>

<p>"My wife isn't ill&mdash;only lame; and she loves
young people. She'll be just as eager for you to
come as Quentina will be&mdash;and Quentina just simply
won't take 'no' for an answer, I'm sure. She
talked for days of the Happy Hexagons, after your
letter came. You must come, only&mdash;" he hesitated,
"only I'm afraid you'll be a little cramped for room.
A village parsonage isn't a ranch, you know. But,
if you don't mind sort of&mdash;picnicking, and having
to stand up in the corner to sleep&mdash;" he paused
quizzically.</p>

<p>"We adore standing up and sleeping in corners,"
declared Genevieve, promptly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then shall we call it Tuesday?" smiled Mr.
Jones.</p>

<p>"But how can they go?" questioned Mrs. Kennedy,
in an anxious voice.</p>

<p>"Why, they might ride it," began Mr. Hartley,
slowly; "still, that would hardly do&mdash;even should
the ponies come in time&mdash;such a long trip when
they haven't ridden any here, yet. I'll tell you.
We'll let Carlos drive them over in the carriage
early Tuesday morning. I reckon the seven of them
can stow themselves away, somehow&mdash;it holds six
with room to spare on every seat. Then, Wednesday
afternoon, he can drive them back. Meanwhile,
he can stay himself in the town and get some supplies
that I'm needing."</p>

<p>"But seems to me that gives us a very short
visit," demurred Mr. Jones, as he rose to take his
leave.</p>

<p>"Quite long enough&mdash;for the good wife," declared
Mrs. Kennedy, decisively. And thus the
matter was settled.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>QUENTINA</h3>


<p>Quite the most absorbing topic of conversation
Monday was, of course, the coming visit to Quentina
Jones.</p>

<p>"But what <i>is</i> her name?" demanded Mr. Hartley
at last, almost impatiently. "It isn't 'Quentina,'
of course. I <i>know</i> that man who was here
Sunday would never have named a daughter of his
'Quentina.'"</p>

<p>"Her name is 'Clorinda Dorinda,'" replied
Genevieve. "She told us so in her letter; but she
said she was always called 'Quentina.' I don't
know why."</p>

<p>"Whew! I should think she would be," laughed
Mr. Hartley. "Only fancy having to be called
'Clorinda Dorinda' whenever you were wanted!"</p>

<p>"Sounds like a rhyming dictionary to me,"
chuckled Tilly. "'Clorinda, Dorinda, Lucinda,
Miranda,'" she chanted.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley laughed, and walked off.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll leave her to you, anyhow, whatever
she is," he called back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll bet he's just dying to go with us, all the
same," whispered Tilly, saucily.</p>

<p>Cordelia frowned, hesitated, then spoke.</p>

<p>"Auntie says ladies don't bet," she observed, in
her severest manner.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't they?" snapped Tilly; then she, too,
frowned, and hesitated. "All right, Cordy&mdash;Cordelia;
see that you don't do it, then," she concluded
good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Monday was a very quiet day for the girls at the
ranch. Mrs. Kennedy had insisted from the first
upon this. She said that the next two days would be
quite exciting enough to call for all the rest possible
beforehand. So, except for the usual watching of
the boys' morning start to work, there was little but
music, books, and letter-writing allowed.</p>

<p>Tuesday dawned clear, but very warm. The girls
were all awake at sunrise, and were soon ready for
the early breakfast. Almost at once, afterward,
they stowed themselves&mdash;with little crowding but
much giggling&mdash;in the carriage, and called gayly
to Carlos: "We're all ready!"</p>

<p>"Yes, we're all aboard, Carlos," cried Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Good, Se&ntilde;orita! It is ver' glad I am to see you
so prompt to the halter," grinned Carlos. "<i>Quien
sabe?</i>&mdash;mebbe I didn't reckon on corrallin' the
whole bunch of you so soon!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed, even while she made a wry
face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm afraid Carlos remembers that I was never
on time, girls," she pouted. "But you don't know,
Carlos, what a marvel of promptness I've become
back East&mdash;specially since somebody gave me a
watch," she finished, smiling into the old man's
face.</p>

<p>"All ready!" grinned Carlos, climbing into his
seat.</p>

<p>"Let's give our Texas yell," proposed Tilly,
softly, as she looked back to see Mrs. Kennedy, Mr.
Hartley, and Mammy Lindy on the gallery steps.
"Now count, Cordelia!"</p>

<p>And Cordelia did count. Once again her face expressed
a tragedy of responsibility, and once again
the resulting</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Texas, Texas, Tex&mdash;Tex&mdash;Texas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Texas, Texas, Rah! Rah! Rah!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">GENEVIEVE!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>was the glorious success it ought to have been. So
to a responsive chorus of shouts, laughter, and
hand-clapping, the Happy Hexagons drove away
from the ranch house.</div>

<p>It was a pleasant drive, though a warm one. It
did seem a little long, too, so anxious were they to
reach their goal. The prairie sights and sounds,
though interesting, were not so new, now. Even
the two or three herds of cattle they met, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
groups of cowboys they saw galloping across the
prairies, did not create quite the excitement they
always had created heretofore. Quentina and the
minister's home were so much more interesting to
think of!</p>

<p>"What do you suppose she'll be like?" asked
Elsie.</p>

<p>"<i>Quien sabe?</i>" laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"There! what does that mean?" demanded
Tilly. "I've heard it lots of times since I've been
here."</p>

<p>"'Who knows?'" translated Genevieve,
smilingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, who does know?" retorted Tilly, not understanding.
"But what does it mean?"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed outright.</p>

<p>"That's just what it means&mdash;'Who knows?'
The Mexicans and the cowboys use it a lot here,
and when I come back I get to saying it, too."</p>

<p>"I should think you did," shrugged Tilly.
"Well, anyhow, let's talk straight English for
a while. Let's talk of Quentina. What do you suppose
she's like, girls?"</p>

<p>"Let's guess," proposed Genevieve. "We can,
you know, for Miss Jones was too sick to tell us
anything, and we haven't a thing to go by but
Quentina's letter, and that didn't tell much."</p>

<p>"All right, let's guess. Let's make a game of
it," cried Tilly. "We'll each tell what we think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and then see who comes the nearest. You begin,
Genevieve."</p>

<p>"All right. I think she's quiet and tall, and very
dark like a Spaniard," announced Genevieve, weighing
her words carefully.</p>

<p>"I think she's bookish, and maybe stupid," declared
Tilly. "Her letter sounded queer."</p>

<p>"I think she's little, and got yellow hair and
light-blue eyes," said Bertha.</p>

<p>"I think she's got curls&mdash;black ones&mdash;and
looks lovely in red," declared Elsie Martin.</p>

<p>"We can trust you, Elsie, to get in something
about her clothes," chuckled Tilly.</p>

<p>"Well, I think she's got brown eyes like Genevieve's,
and brown hair like hers, too," asserted
Alma Lane.</p>

<p>"Now, Cordelia," smiled Genevieve, "it's your
turn. You haven't said, yet."</p>

<p>"There isn't anything left for me to say," replied
Cordelia, in a slightly worried voice. "You've
got all the pretty things used up. I should just have
to say I think she's fat and homely&mdash;and I don't
think I ought to say that, for it would be a downright
fib. I don't think she's that at all!"</p>

<p>There was a general laugh at this; then, for a
time, there was silence while the carriage rolled
along the prairie road.</p>

<p>Carlos had no difficulty in finding the home of
the Rev. Mr. Jones in Bolo. It proved to be a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
little house, unattractive, and very plain. It looked
particularly forlorn with its bare little front yard,
in which some one had made an attempt to raise
nasturtiums and petunias.</p>

<p>"Mercy! I guess we'll <i>have</i> to stand up in corners
to sleep," gurgled Tilly, as the carriage stopped
before the side door.</p>

<p>"Sh-h!" warned Genevieve. "Tilly, isn't it
awful? Only think of our Quentina's living here!"</p>

<p>At that moment the door of the little house
opened, and Mr. Jones appeared. From around his
feet there seemed literally to tumble out upon the
steps several boys of "assorted sizes," as Tilly expressed
it afterward. Then the girls saw her in
the doorway&mdash;Quentina. She was slender, not
very tall, but very pretty, with large, dark eyes, and
fine yellow hair that fluffed and curled all about her
forehead and ears and neck.</p>

<p>"O Happy Hexagons, Happy Hexagons, welcome,
welcome, Happy Hexagons!" breathed the
girl in the doorway ecstatically, clasping her hands.</p>

<p>"Sounds almost like our Texas yell," giggled
Tilly, under her breath.</p>

<p>Genevieve was the first to reach the ground.</p>

<p>"Quentina&mdash;I know you're Quentina; and I'm
Genevieve Hartley," she cried, before Mr. Jones
had a chance to speak.</p>

<p>"Yes, this is Quentina," he said then, cordially
shaking Genevieve's hand. "And now I'll let you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
present her to your young friends, please, because
you can do it so much better than I."</p>

<p>They were all out now, on the ground, hanging
back a little diffidently. It was this, perhaps, that
made Cordelia think that something ought to be
said or done. She came hurriedly forward as she
caught Genevieve's eye and heard her own name
called.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm Cordelia, and I'm so glad to see you,"
she stammered; "and I'm so glad you're not fat
and homely, too&mdash;er&mdash;that is," she corrected
feverishly, "I mean&mdash;we didn't any of us get you
right, you know."</p>

<p>"Get me&mdash;right?" Quentina opened her dark
eyes to their fullest extent.</p>

<p>Cordelia blushed, and tried to back away. With
her eyes she implored Tilly or Elsie to take her
place.</p>

<p>It was Genevieve who came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"We'll have to own up, Quentina," she laughed.
"On the way here we were trying to picture how
you look; and of course we each had to guess a
different thing, so we got all kinds of combinations."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we didn't get yours," chuckled Tilly,
coming easily forward, with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Indeed we didn't," echoed Elsie, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Why, of course we couldn't," stammered Cordelia,
still red of face. "We never, never <i>could</i>
think of anything so pretty as you really are!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>Quentina laughed now, and raised hurried hands
to hide the pretty red that had flown to her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, you funny, funny Happy Hexagons!" she
cried, in her sweet, Southern drawl.</p>

<p>Naturally there could be nothing stiff about the
introductions, after that, and they were dispatched
in short order, even to Mr. Jones's pulling the boys
into line, and announcing:</p>

<p>"This is Paul, with the solemn face. And this
grinning little chap is Edward&mdash;Ned, for short;
and these are the twins, Bob and Rob."</p>

<p>"Are they both 'Robert'?" questioned Tilly, interestedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Jones smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Bob is Bolton, and Rob is Robert.
The 'Rob and Bob' is Quentina's idea&mdash;she likes
the sound of it."</p>

<p>"I told you!&mdash;she <i>is</i> a rhyming dictionary,"
whispered Tilly, in an aside that nearly convulsed
the two girls that heard her.</p>

<p>Inside the house they all met "mother."</p>

<p>Mother, in spite of her lame foot, was a very
forceful personality. She was bright and cheery,
too, and she made the girls feel welcome and at
home immediately.</p>

<p>"It's so good of you to come!" she exclaimed.
"Poor Quentina has been shut up with me for
weeks. But I'm better, now&mdash;lots better; and I
shall soon be about again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it was very good of you to let us come,"
returned Genevieve, politely, "specially when you
aren't well yourself. But we'll try not to make you
any more trouble than we can't help."</p>

<p>"Trouble, dear child! I reckon we don't call <i>you</i>
trouble," declared the minister's wife, fervently,
"after all your kindness to my daughter, Alice."
Genevieve raised a protesting hand, but Mrs. Jones
went on smilingly. "And then that letter to Quentina&mdash;she's
never ceased to talk and dream of the
girls who sent it to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I did like it so much&mdash;indeed I did,"
chimed in Quentina. "Why, Genevieve, I made a
poem on it&mdash;a lovely poem just like Tennyson's
'Margaret,' you know; only I put in 'Hexagons,'
and changed the words to fit, of course."</p>

<p>Tilly nudged Elsie violently, and Elsie choked a
spasmodic giggle into a cough; but Quentina unhesitatingly
went on.</p>

<p>"It began:</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"'O sweet pale Hexagons,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">O rare pale Hexagons,</span><br />
What lit your eyes with tearful power,<br />
Like moonlight on a falling shower?<br />
Why sent you, loves, so full and free,<br />
Your letter sweet to little me?'<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>That's just the first, you know," smiled Quentina,
engagingly, "and of course when I wrote it I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
know you weren't really 'pale,' at all; but then,
we can just call that part poetic license."</div>

<p>Genevieve laughed frankly. Tilly giggled. Cordelia
looked nervously from them to Quentina.</p>

<p>"I'm sure, that&mdash;that's very pretty," she faltered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones smiled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, for a little, you won't know just
what to make of Quentina," she explained laughingly.
"We're used to her turning everything into
jingles, but strangers are not."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I don't," cried Quentina, reproachfully.
"There's heaps and heaps of things that I
never wrote a line of poetry about. But how could
I help it?&mdash;that beautiful letter, and the Happy
Hexagons, and all! It just wrote itself. I sent it
East, too, to a magazine, two or three times&mdash;but
they didn't put it in," she added, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Why, what a shame!" murmured Tilly.</p>

<p>Genevieve looked up quickly. Tilly was wearing
her most innocent, most angelic expression, but
Genevieve knew very well the naughtiness behind it.
Quentina, however, accepted it as pure gold.</p>

<p>"Yes, wasn't it?" she rejoined cheerfully. "I
felt right bad, particularly as I was going to send
you all a copy when it was published."</p>

<p>"You can give us a manuscript copy, Quentina.
We would love that," interposed Genevieve, hurriedly.
Behind Quentina's back she gave Tilly then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a frowning shake of the head&mdash;though it must be
confessed that her dancing eyes rather spoiled the
effect of it.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's because her name rhymes&mdash;'Clorinda
Dorinda,'" suggested Tilly, interestedly;
"maybe that's why she likes to write poetry so well."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones laughed.</p>

<p>"That's what her father says. But Clorinda herself
changed her own name about as soon as she
could talk. She couldn't manage the hard 'Clorinda'
very well, and I had a Mexican nurse girl,
Quentina, whose name she much preferred. So
very soon she was calling herself 'Quentina,' and
insisting that every one else should do the same."</p>

<p>"But it's so much prettier," declared the minister's
daughter, fervently. "Of course 'Clorinda
Dorinda' are some pretty, because they rhyme so,
but I like 'Quentina' better. Besides, there are
lots more pretty words to make that rhyme with&mdash;Florena,
Dulcina, Rowena, and verbena, you know."</p>

<p>"And 'you've seen her,'" suggested Tilly,
gravely.</p>

<p>Quentina frowned a moment in thought.</p>

<p>"Y-yes," she admitted; "but I don't think that's
a very pretty one."</p>

<p>It was Genevieve this time who choked a giggle
into a cough, and who, a moment later, turned very
eagerly to welcome an interruption in the person
of the Rev. Mr. Jones.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after this Quentina suggested a trip through
the house.</p>

<p>"You see I want to show you where you're going
to sleep," she explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Jones told us that," observed Tilly, as
the seven girls trooped up the narrow stairway.
"He said we were to stand up in the corners."
Tilly spoke with the utmost gravity.</p>

<p>Quentina turned, wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"Why, you couldn't! You'd never sleep a bit,"
she demurred concernedly. "Besides, it isn't necessary."</p>

<p>All but Tilly and Genevieve tittered audibly.
Tilly still looked the picture of innocence.
Genevieve frowned at her sternly, then stepped forward
and put her arm around Quentina's waist.</p>

<p>"Tilly was only joking, Quentina," she explained.
"When you know Tilly better you'll
find she never by any chance talks sense&mdash;but
always nonsense," she finished, looking at Tilly
severely.</p>

<p>Tilly wrinkled up her nose and pouted; but her
eyes laughed.</p>

<p>"There, here's my room," announced Quentina, a
moment later. "We've put a couch in it, and if you
don't mind my sleeping with you, three can be here.
Then across the hall here is the twins' room, and
two more can sleep in this; and Paul and Ned's
room down there at the end of the hall will take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
the other two. There! You see we've got it fixed
right well."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;well for us; but how about the
boys?" cried Genevieve. "Where will they
sleep?"</p>

<p>Quentina's lips parted, but before the words were
uttered, a new thought seemed to have come to her.
With an odd little glance at Tilly, she drawled demurely:</p>

<p>"Oh, they are going to sleep in the corners."</p>

<p>They all laughed this time.</p>

<p>"Well, now we've done the whole house, and
we'll take the yard," proposed Quentina, as, a little
later, she led the way down-stairs and out of doors.
"There! aren't my nasturtiums beautiful?" she
exulted, with the air of a fond mother displaying
her first-born. She was pointing to a bed of straggling,
puny plants, beautifully free from weeds, and
showing here and there a few brilliant blossoms.</p>

<p>Tilly turned her back suddenly. Cordelia looked
distressed. Bertha cried thoughtlessly:</p>

<p>"Oh, but you ought to see Genevieve's, Quentina,
if you want to see nasturtiums!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I have Carlos," cut in Genevieve, hurriedly,
"and Carlos can make anything grow.
What a pretty dark one this is," she finished, bending
over one of the plants.</p>

<p>Quentina's face clouded.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose they are much, really," she admitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
"But I've worked so hard over them!
Father says the earth isn't good at all. I was so
pleased when that big red one came out! I made
a poem on it right off:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'O nasturtium, sweet nasturtium,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Did you blossom just for me?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Where, oh, where did you unearth 'em&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">All those colors that I see?'</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>That's the way it began. Wasn't I lucky to think
of that 'unearth 'em?' Besides, it's really true,
you know. They do unearth 'em, and 'twas such a
nice rhyme for nasturtium. Now there's petunia;
I think that's a perfectly beautiful sounding word,
but I've never been able to find a single thing that
rhymed with it. I do love flowers so," she added,
after a moment; "but we've never had many. They
always burn up, or dry up, or get eaten up, or just
don't come up at all. Of course we've never had
a really pretty place. Ministers like us don't, you
know," she finished cheerfully.</div>

<p>There was no reply to this. Not one of the
Happy Hexagons could think of anything to say.
For once even Tilly was at a loss for words. It
was Quentina herself who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Now tell me all about the East. Let's go up
on the gallery and sit down. I do so want to go
East to school; but of course I can't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"Oh, it costs too much," returned Quentina.
"You know ministers don't have money for such
things." Her voice was still impersonally cheerful.</p>

<p>"How old are you?" asked Elsie, as they seated
themselves on chairs and steps.</p>

<p>"Sixteen last month."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you could go," cried Genevieve.
"Wouldn't it be just lovely if you could come to
Sunbridge and go to school with us!"</p>

<p>"Where is Sunbridge? I always thought of it
as just 'East,' you know."</p>

<p>"In New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Quentina, with a sigh of disappointment.
"I hoped it was in Massachusetts, near
Boston, you know. I thought Alice said it was near
Boston."</p>

<p>"Well, we aren't so awfully far from Boston,"
bridled Tilly. "It only takes an hour and a half
or less to go there. I go with mother every little
while when I'm home."</p>

<p>Quentina sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Boston! Oh, girls, you don't know how I want
to see Boston, and Paul Revere's grave, and the
Common, and the old State House, and Bunker
Hill, and that lovely North Church where they
hung the lantern, you know.</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Listen, my children, and you shall hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,'"</span><br /></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<div class='unindent'>she began to chant impressively. "Oh, don't you
just love that poem?"</div>

<p>"Who was Paul Revere?" asked Tilly, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Paul Revere!" exclaimed Quentina, plainly
shocked. "Who was <i>Paul Revere!</i>"</p>

<p>"Tilly!" scolded Genevieve, as soon as she could
command her voice. "Quentina, that's only some
of Tilly's nonsense. Tilly knows very well who
Paul Revere was."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course she does; and we all do," interposed
Elsie Martin. "But I'll own right up, I
don't know half as much about all those historical
things and places as I ought to."</p>

<p>"Neither do I," chimed in Bertha. "Just because
they're right there handy, and we can go any
time, we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We <i>don't</i> go any time," laughed Alma Lane,
finishing the sentence for her.</p>

<p>"I know it," said Elsie. "We had a cousin with
us for two weeks last summer, and she just doted
on old relics and graveyards. She made us take her
into Boston 'most every day, and she asked all sorts
of questions which I couldn't answer."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but excuse me, please," put in
Tilly, flippantly. "I don't want any graveyards
and relics in mine."</p>

<p>"That's slang, Tilly," reproved Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Is it?" murmured Tilly, serenely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Besides, people come from miles and miles just
to see those things that we neglect, right at our
doors, almost."</p>

<p>"But how can you neglect them?" remonstrated
Quentina. "Why, if I ever go to Boston, I
sha'n't sleep nor eat till I've seen Paul Revere's
grave!"</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't sleep nor eat if I did," shuddered
Tilly.</p>

<p>"You mean you've <i>never</i> seen it?" gasped Quentina,
unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Guilty!" Tilly held up her hand unblushingly.</p>

<p>"Never you mind, Quentina," soothed Genevieve.
"We are interested in those things, really."</p>

<p>"Then you have seen it?"</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;n-no, not that one," confessed Genevieve,
coloring. "But I've seen heaps of other graves
there," she assured her hopefully, as if graves were
the only open door to Quentina's favor.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've had such chances," envied Quentina.
"Just think&mdash;Boston! You <i>said</i> you were
near Boston?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Less than two hours away?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," exclaimed Tilly, "I told you.
We're less than an hour and a half away."</p>

<p>"And are you a D. A. R., and Colonial Dames,
and Mayflower Society members, and all that?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me! I don't know," laughed Genevieve.
"Why?"</p>

<p>"And do you read the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, and eat
beans Saturday night, and fishballs Sunday morning?"
still hurried on Quentina. "You don't any
of you wear glasses, and I don't think you speak
very low."</p>

<p>"Anything else?" asked Tilly politely.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, lots of things," answered Quentina,
"but I've forgotten most of them."</p>

<p>"Quentina, what <i>are</i> you talking about?"
laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>Quentina smiled oddly, then she sighed.</p>

<p>"It wasn't true, of course. I knew it couldn't
be."</p>

<p>"What wasn't true?"</p>

<p>"Something I found in one of father's church
papers about Rules for Living in New England. I
cut it out. Wait a minute&mdash;it's here, somewhere!"
And, to the girls' amazement, she dived into a pocket
at the side of her dress, pulling out several clippings
which seemed, mostly, to be verse. One was prose,
and it was on this she pounced. "Here it is.
Listen." And she read:</p>

<p>"'Rules for Living in New England. You must
be descended from the Puritans, and should belong
to the Mayflower Society, or be a D. A. R., a Colonial
Dame, or an S. A. R. You must graduate from
Harvard, or Radcliffe, and must disdain all other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
colleges. You must quote Emerson, read the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, and swear by the <i>Transcript</i>. You
must wear glasses, speak in a low voice, eat beans
on Saturday night, and fishballs on Sunday morning.
Always you must carry with you a green bag,
and you should be a professional man, or woman,
preferably of the literary variety. You should live
not farther away from Boston than two hours' ride,
and of course you will be devoted to tombstones,
relics, and antiques. You may tolerate Europe, but
you must ignore the West. You must be slow of
speech, dignified of conduct, and serene of temper.
You must never be surprised, nor display undue
emotion. Above all, you must be <i>cultured</i>.'</p>

<p>"Now you see you haven't done all those things,"
she declared, as she finished the article.</p>

<p>"I reckon there are a few omissions&mdash;specially
on my part," laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"But you are happy there?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I am!"</p>

<p>"How I do wish I could go," sighed Quentina.
"I should love Boston, I know. Alice did&mdash;though
she still liked Texas better."</p>

<p>"Well, I know Boston would love you," chuckled
Tilly, unexpectedly. "Girls, wouldn't she be a picnic
in Sunbridge? She'd be more of a circus than
you were, Genevieve!"</p>

<p>"Thank you," bowed Genevieve, with mock stiffness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, we loved you right away&mdash;and we should
Quentina, of course."</p>

<p>"Thank you," bowed Quentina, in her turn,
laughingly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE OPENING OF A BARREL</h3>


<p>It was a merry afternoon and evening that the
Happy Hexagons spent at Quentina's home, and it
was still a merrier time that they had getting settled
for the night. Even Tilly said at last:</p>

<p>"Well, Quentina, it's lucky a lame foot doesn't
have ears. I don't know what your mother will say
to us!"</p>

<p>"Only fancy if Miss Jane were here," shivered
Genevieve.</p>

<p>It was just as the family were finishing breakfast
the next morning that there came a knock at the
door, and a man rolled in a large barrel.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's the missionary barrel&mdash;our barrel from
the East!" cried Quentina. "I wonder now&mdash;what
do you suppose there is in it?"</p>

<p>"There isn't anything, I reckon, except old
things," piped up Rob, shrilly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones colored painfully.</p>

<p>"Robert, my son!" she remonstrated, in evident
distress.</p>

<p>"Well, mother, you <i>know</i> there isn't&mdash;most
generally," defended Robert.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"And if they <i>are</i> new, they're the sort of things
we couldn't ever use," added Ned.</p>

<p>"Boys, boys, that will do," commanded the minister,
quickly.</p>

<p>The minister, with Paul's help, had the barrel
nearly open by this time.</p>

<p>"It isn't from Sunbridge, is it?" asked Genevieve.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;though we get them from there sometimes;
but this is from a little town in Vermont,"
replied Mrs. Jones. "We had a letter last week
from the minister. He&mdash;he apologized a little;
said that times had been hard, and that they'd had
trouble to fill it. As if it wasn't hard enough for us
to take it, without that!" she finished bitterly, with
almost a sob.</p>

<p>"Rita, my dear!" murmured her husband, in a
low, distressed voice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones dashed quick tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I know; I don't mean to be ungrateful. But&mdash;times
have been a little hard&mdash;with <i>us!</i>"</p>

<p>Silent, and a little awed, the Happy Hexagons
stood at one side. Genevieve, especially, looked out
from troubled eyes. Very slowly Genevieve was
waking up to the fact that not every one in the world
had luxuries, or even what she would call ordinary
comforts of living. Mrs. Jones, seeing her face,
spoke hurriedly.</p>

<p>"There, there, girls, please forget what I said!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
It was very kind of those good people to send the
barrel&mdash;very kind; and I am sure we shall find in
it just what we want."</p>

<p>"I know what you hope will be there," cried Bob,
"a new coat for Father, and a dress for you, and
some underclothes for us boys. I heard you say so
last night."</p>

<p>"Yes; and Quentina wants a ribbon&mdash;not dirty
ones," observed Rob.</p>

<p>"Robert!" cried Quentina, very red of face.
"You know I don't <i>expect</i> anything of the sort."</p>

<p>The barrel was open now, and eagerly the
family gathered around it. Even Mrs. Jones's chair
was drawn forward so that she, too, might peep
into it.</p>

<p>First there was a great quantity of newspapers&mdash;the
people had, indeed, found trouble to fill it,
evidently. Next came a pincushion&mdash;faded pink
satin, frilled with not over-clean white lace.</p>

<p>"I can use the lace for a collar," cried Quentina,
taking prompt possession of the cushion. "I'm
right glad of this!"</p>

<p>A picture came next in a tarnished gilt frame&mdash;evidently
somebody's early attempts to paint nasturtiums
in oil.</p>

<p>"There's a rival for your posies out in the yard,"
murmured Tilly in Quentina's ear.</p>

<p>A pair of skates was pulled out next, then three
dolls, one minus an arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"These might be good&mdash;on ice," remarked
Paul, who had picked up the skates.</p>

<p>"Do you ever have any ice to skate on, here?"
asked Bertha.</p>

<p>"Not in the part of Texas I've ever been in," he
sighed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones was ruefully smoothing the one-armed
doll's flimsy dress.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I <i>told</i> them there were no little girls in the
family," she said, her worried eyes seeking her husband's
face. "It&mdash;it's all right, of course; only&mdash;only
these dolls did take space."</p>

<p>Some magazines came next, and a few old books,
upon which the boys fell greedily&mdash;though the
books they soon threw to one side as if they were of
little interest.</p>

<p>Undergarments appeared then, plainly much
worn and patched. To Genevieve they looked quite
impossible. She almost cried when she saw how
eagerly Mrs. Jones gathered the motley pile into her
arms and began to sort them out with little
exclamations of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Next in the barrel were found an ink-stained
apron, a bath-robe, nearly new&mdash;which plainly
owed its presence to its hideous colors&mdash;two or
three tin dishes (not new), a harmonica, a box containing
a straw hat trimmed with drooping blue
bows, several fans, a box of dominoes, a pocket-knife
with a broken blade, several pairs of new hose,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
marked plainly "seconds," some sheets and pillow-cases
(half-worn, but hailed with joy by Mrs.
Jones), a kimono, an assortment of men's half-worn
shoes&mdash;pounced upon at once by Paul and
his father, and not abandoned until it was found
that only two were mates, and only one of these
good for much wear.</p>

<p>It was at this point that there came a muffled
shout from Ned, whose head was far down in the
barrel.</p>

<p>"Here's a package&mdash;a big one&mdash;and it's
marked 'dress for Mrs. Jones.' Mother, you did
get it, after all!" he cried, tumbling the package
into his mother's lap.</p>

<p>Tremblingly half a dozen pairs of hands attempted
to untie the strings and to unwrap the
coverings; then, across Mrs. Jones's lap there lay
a tawdry dress of pale-blue silk, spotted and soiled.
Pinned to it was a note in a scrawling feminine
hand: "This will wash and make over nicely, I
think, if you can't wear it just as it is."</p>

<p>"We have so many chances to wear light-blue
silk, too," was all that Mrs. Jones said.</p>

<p>In the bottom of the barrel were a few new
towels, very coarse, and some tablecloths and small,
fringed napkins, also very coarse.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure, these are handy," stammered
the minister, who had not found his coat.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered his wife, wearily; "only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>&mdash;well,
it so happens that every box for the last five
years has held tea-napkins&mdash;and I don't give many
teas, you know, dear."</p>

<p>Genevieve choked back a sob.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I never saw such a&mdash;a horrid thing in
all my life, as that barrel was," she stormed hotly.
"I don't see what folks were thinking of&mdash;to send
such things!"</p>

<p>"They weren't thinking, my dear, and that's just
what the trouble was," answered Mrs. Jones, gently.
"They didn't think, nor understand. Besides, there
are very many nice things here that we can use
beautifully. There always are, in every box, only&mdash;of
course, some things <i>aren't</i> so useful."</p>

<p>"I should say not!" snapped Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't suppose anything could make me
glad because Aunt Kate makes over the girls' things
for me," spoke up Elsie Martin; "but something
has now. She can't send them in any missionary
boxes, anyhow!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jones laughed, though she looked still more
disturbed.</p>

<p>"But, girls, dear girls, please don't say such
things," she expostulated. "We are very, very
grateful&mdash;indeed we are; and it is right kind of
them to remember us far-away missionaries with
boxes and barrels!"</p>

<p>"'Missionary'!" sputtered Genevieve. "'Missionary'!
I should think somebody had better be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
missionary to them, and teach them what to send.
Dolls and skates, indeed!"</p>

<p>"But, my dear," smiled Mrs. Jones, "those
might have been just the things&mdash;in some places;
and besides, some of the boxes are&mdash;are better than
this. Indeed they are!"</p>

<p>It was at this point that Cordelia came forward
hurriedly, and touched Mrs. Jones's arm. Her face
was a little white and strained looking.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Jones," she faltered, "I think I ought to
tell you. I'm a minister's niece, and I've seen lots
of missionary boxes packed. I know just how they
do it, too. I know just how thoughtless they&mdash;I
mean we&mdash;are; and I just wanted to say that I'm
very, very sure the next time we pack a box for
any missionary, we'll&mdash;we'll see that our old shoes
are mates, and that we don't send dolls to boys!"</p>

<p>There was a shout of gleeful appreciation from
the boys, but there were only troubled sighs and
frowns on the part of Mr. and Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I&mdash;I wish the barrel hadn't come
when you were here," regretted the minister's wife;
"for indeed the things are all very, very nice. Indeed
they are!"</p>

<p>"And now let's go out to the flowers," proposed
Quentina. "Maybe a new nasturtium has blossomed."</p>

<p>All but one of the girls had left the room when
Mr. Jones felt a timid touch on his arm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Jones, could I speak to you&mdash;just a
minute, please?" asked a low voice. "I'm Cordelia
Wilson, you know."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Miss Cordelia! What can I
do for you?" he answered genially, leading the way
to the tiny study off the sitting room.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not sure you can do anything," replied
Cordelia, with hesitating truthfulness. "But
I wanted to ask: <i>do</i> you know anybody in Texas by
the name of Mr. John Sanborn, or Mrs. Lizzie Higgins,
or Mr. Lester Goodwin, or Mr. James Hunt?"</p>

<p>The minister looked a little surprised.</p>

<p>"N-no, I can't say that I do," he said, slowly.</p>

<p>Cordelia's countenance fell.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry! You see I thought&mdash;being
a minister out here, so,&mdash;you might know them."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Texas is quite a large state," he reminded
her, with a smile.</p>

<p>"I know," sighed the girl. "I've found that
out."</p>

<p>"Are these people friends of yours?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; they're just a son, and a brother, and
a cousin, and a runaway daughter that I'm looking
up for Sunbridge people."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" The minister hoped his voice
was politely steady.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Of course I haven't had a chance to
ask many people, yet&mdash;only one or two of the cowboys.
One of them was named 'John,' but he wasn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
my John&mdash;I mean, he wasn't the right John," corrected
Cordelia with a pink blush.</p>

<p>The minister coughed a little spasmodically behind
his hand. As he did not speak Cordelia went
on, her eyes a little wistful.</p>

<p>"Would you be willing, please, to take those
names down on paper, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, Miss Cordelia," agreed the
man, reaching for his notebook.</p>

<p>"You see you <i>are</i> a minister, and you do meet
people, so you might find them. I'd be so glad if
you could, or if I could. They're all needed very
much&mdash;indeed they are. You see, Hermit Joe is
so lonesome for his son, and Mrs. Snow so worried
about Lizzie, and Mrs. Granger has lost her husband,
so she hasn't anybody left but her cousin, now,
and Miss Sally is so very poor and needs her brother
so much."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course," murmured the minister.</p>

<p>A few moments later his notebook bore this
entry, which had been made under Cordelia's careful
direction:</p>

<p>"If I find any of these people I'll convey all your
messages to the best of my ability," promised the
minister.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Then I'll go out now to the nasturtiums,"
sighed the girl, contentedly.</p>

<p>All too soon the visit came to a close, and all too
soon Carlos appeared with the carriage. Then came
hurried good-byes, full of laughter, tears, and promises,
with all the Jones family except the mother,
grouped upon the steps&mdash;and the mother's chair
was close to the window.</p>

<div class='poem'>

<div class='unindent'>chanted Quentina, waving one handkerchief, and
wiping her eyes with another.</div>

<p>"Girls, quick!&mdash;give her the Texas yell," cried
Genevieve in a low voice; "only say 'Quentina'
at the end instead of my name. Now, remember&mdash;'Quentina'!"
she finished excitedly.</p>

<p>"Good!" exulted Tilly. "Of course we will!
Now count, Cordelia."</p>

<p>A moment later, Quentina's amazed, delighted
ears heard:</p>

<div class='unindent'>Then, amidst a chorus of shouts and laughter, the
carriage drove away.</div>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"Well, young ladies," demanded Mr. Hartley,
when the tired but happy Hexagon Club trooped up
the front steps of the ranch house late that afternoon,
"how about it? What did you think of the
fair Quentina?"</p>

<p>"Think of her! O Quentina, you should 'seen
her!" sang Tilly, in so perfect an imitation of the
minister's daughter that the girls broke into peals
of laughter.</p>

<p>"She's lovely, Father&mdash;honestly, she is," declared
Genevieve, as soon as she could speak.</p>

<p>"And so pretty!" added Cordelia, "and has
such a sweet, slow way of speaking!"</p>

<p>"Such lovely dark eyes!"&mdash;this from Alma.</p>

<p>"And such glorious hair&mdash;all golden and
kinky!" breathed Bertha.</p>

<p>"And she looks just as pretty in her high-necked
apron as she does in her white dress," cried
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Well, well, upon my soul! What is this young
lady&mdash;a paragon?" laughed Mr. Hartley, raising
his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you just what she is, sir," vouchsafed
Tilly, confidentially. "She <i>is</i> a rhyming dictionary,
Mr. Hartley, just as I said in the first place; and
I'd be willing to guarantee any time that she'd find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a rhyme for any word in this or any other language
within two seconds after the gun is fired. If you
don't believe it, you should hear her 'unearth 'em'
on the 'nasturtium.'"</p>

<p>"Tilly, Tilly!" choked Genevieve, convulsively.</p>

<p>"Oh, but she <i>said</i> she couldn't find one for
petunia," broke in the exact Cordelia.</p>

<p>"You don't mean she actually writes&mdash;<i>poetry!</i>"
ejaculated Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Writes it!&mdash;my dear lady!" (Tilly had assumed
her most superior air.) "If that were all!
But she talks it, day in and day out. Everything
is a poem, from a letter to a scraggly nasturtium.
She carries an unfailing supply of her own verses in
her head, and of other people's in her pocket. If
you ask for the butter at the table, you're never
sure she won't strike an attitude, and chant:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Butter, Butter, Oh, good-by!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Better butter ne'er did&mdash;er&mdash;fly.'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>"I think I should like to see this young person,"
observed Mrs. Kennedy, when the laughter at
Tilly's sally had subsided.</p>

<p>"Maybe you will sometime. She wants to go
East," rejoined Tilly.</p>

<p>"She does? What for?"</p>

<p>"Principally to see Paul Revere's grave, I believe;
incidentally to go to school."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I wish she could come East to school!" exclaimed
Genevieve.</p>

<p>"So do I&mdash;if she'd come to Sunbridge," laughed
Tilly. "She takes things even more literally than
Cordelia does. Sometime I'm going to tell her the
moon <i>is</i> made of green cheese, and ask her if she
doesn't want a piece. Ten to one if she won't answer
that she doesn't care for cheese, thank you.
Oh, I wouldn't ask to go to <i>another</i> show for a
whole year if she should come to Sunbridge!"</p>

<p>"Tilly! I don't think you ought to talk like
that," remonstrated Cordelia. "One would think
that Quentina was a&mdash;a vaudeville show."</p>

<p>Tilly considered this gravely.</p>

<p>"Why, Cordelia, do you know?&mdash;I believe that
is <i>just</i> what she is. Thank you so much for thinking
of it."</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Cordelia, horrified.</p>

<p>Genevieve frowned.</p>

<p>"Honestly, Tilly, I don't think you are quite
fair," she demurred. "Quentina isn't one bit of
a show. She's sweet and dear and lovely, with
just some funny ways to make her specially interesting."</p>

<p>"All right; we'll let it go at that, then," retorted
Tilly, merrily. "She's just specially interesting."</p>

<p>"She must be," smiled Mrs. Kennedy. "In fact,
I should very much like to see her, and&mdash;I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
believe Tilly means her comments to be quite so
unkind as perhaps they sound," she finished with a
gentle emphasis that was not lost on her young
audience.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>THE PRAIRIE&mdash;AND MOONLIGHT</h3>


<p>One by one the long, happy July days slipped
away. There was no lack of amusement, no time
that hung heavy&mdash;there was so much to be seen,
so much to be done!</p>

<p>Very soon after the trip to Quentina's home, Mr.
Tim produced from somewhere five stout little
ponies, warranted to be broken to "skirts"&mdash;which
Genevieve had said would be absolutely necessary,
as the girls would never consent to ride astride.</p>

<p>It was a nervous morning, however, for five of
the Happy Hexagons when the horses were led up
to the door. Cordelia was frankly white-faced and
trembling. Even Tilly looked a little doubtful, as
she said, trying to speak with her usual lightness:</p>

<p>"Oh, we <i>know</i>, of course, Genevieve, that these
little beasts won't teeter up and down like Reddy's
broncho; and we hope they'll bear in mind that
Westerners ought to be politely gentle with Easterners,
who aren't brought up to ride jumping jacks.
But still, we can't help wondering."</p>

<p>"Genevieve, I&mdash;I really think I won't ride at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
all to-day," stammered Cordelia, faintly; "that is,
if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"But I do mind," rejoined Genevieve, looking
much distressed. "Of course, girls, I wouldn't
urge you against your will, for the world; but we
can't have half the fun here unless you ride, for we
go everywhere, 'most, in the saddle. And, honestly,
Mr. Tim says these horses are regular cows.
Father told him he must get steady ones. Won't
you please&mdash;try it? It will break my heart, if you
don't. You see I've said so much to the boys, since
I came, about your riding! They were so surprised
to think you could ride, and I was so proud to say
you did!"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you were?" stammered Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, young ladies," called Mr. Tim, at that
moment, "here's the steadiest little string of horses
going! Who'll have the first pick?"</p>

<p>"I will," cried Cordelia, wetting her dry lips, and
speaking with a stern determination that yet did not
quite hide the shake in her voice. "That is&mdash;I
don't care about my pick, but I'm going to ride&mdash;right
away&mdash;quick!" she finished, determined that
at least Genevieve should not be ashamed&mdash;of
her.</p>

<p>After all, it was only the first five minutes that
were hard. The little horses were politeness itself,
and seemed fully to realize the responsibilities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
their position. The girls, determined not to shame
Genevieve, acquitted themselves with a grace and
ease that brought forth an appreciative cheer from
the boys as the young people rode away.</p>

<p>"Now I feel as if I were in Texas," exulted
Tilly, drawing in a full breath of the fresh, early
morning air.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad&mdash;so glad we're all in Texas," cried
Genevieve, looking about her with shining eyes.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>According to Tilly, there was always "something
doing" at the ranch house. The boys&mdash;much to
their own surprise, it must be confessed&mdash;had
adopted "the whole bunch" (as Long John called
the young people), and were never too busy or too
tired to display their skill as ropers or riders. Always
there was the fascinating morning start to
work to watch, and frequently there was in the
afternoon some wild little broncho that needed to
be broken to the saddle, or to be trained to stop,
wheel instantly, stand motionless, or to start at top
speed, according to his master's wishes; all of
which was a never-ending source of delight to unaccustomed
Eastern eyes.</p>

<p>For pleasant days there were, too, rides, drives
to Bolo, picnic luncheons, and frolics of every sort.
For rainy days there were games and music in the
living room, to say nothing of letters from home to
be read and answered. Most of the twilights&mdash;if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fair&mdash;were spent by everybody on the front
gallery watching the golden ball in the west set the
whole prairie, as well as the sky itself, on fire. In
the early afternoon, of course, there was the inevitable
siesta&mdash;Tilly's abhorred "naps."</p>

<p>There were callers at the ranch house, too.
Sometimes a cowboy from a neighboring ranch
came to look after a lost pony, or to see if his cattle
had strayed off the range through a broken fence.
Sometimes a hunter or trapper would stop for a
chat on his way to or from Bolo. Once Susie
Billings in her khaki suit and cowboy hat came to
spend the day; and once, on Sunday, Mr. Jones
came to hold service again. Much to the girls'
disappointment, Quentina did not come with him.
The mother's foot was better, Mr. Jones said, but
the twins had come down with the whooping cough,
and poor Quentina could not be spared to leave
home.</p>

<p>Sometimes a score of men and teams and cowboys
with their strings of horses would pass on their
way to a round-up; and once two huge prairie
schooners "docked in the yard," as Tilly termed
it; and their weary owners, at Mr. Hartley's invitation,
stopped for a night's rest.</p>

<p>That was, indeed, a time of great excitement for
the Happy Hexagons, for under Genevieve's fearless
leadership they promptly made friends with the
sallow-faced women and the forlorn children, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
soon were shown the mysteries of the inside of the
wagon-homes.</p>

<p>"Mercy! it looks just like play housekeeping;
doesn't it?" gurgled Tilly.</p>

<p>"But it isn't play at all, my dear," replied one
of the women, a little sadly. "Seems now like as
if I ever had a home again what stayed put, that
I'd be happy, no matter where 'twas. Ain't that
the way you feel, Mis' Higgins?"</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the other woman, dully, from
her perch on the driver's seat. "But I reckon my
man ain't never goin' ter quit wheelin', now."</p>

<p>Even Genevieve seemed scarcely to know what
to reply to this; but a few minutes later she had
succeeded in gaining the confidence of the several
children hanging about their mothers' skirts.
Laughingly, then, the young people trooped away
together to look at the flowers&mdash;all but Cordelia
Wilson. Cordelia remained behind with the two
women.</p>

<p>"Please&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;but did you say
your name was 'Mrs. Higgins'?" she asked
eagerly, turning to the woman on the driver's
seat.</p>

<p>"Why, no&mdash;I didn't, Miss. But that's my
name."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; 'twas the other lady who called
you that, of course; but it doesn't matter, so long
as I know 'tis that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, don't it?" murmured the woman, a little
curiously.</p>

<p>"No; and&mdash;you came from New Hampshire,
once, didn't you?"</p>

<p>An odd look crossed the woman's face.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't sayin' that."</p>

<p>"But you did&mdash;please say that you did," begged
Cordelia. "You see, I'm so anxious to find you!"</p>

<p>A look that was almost terror came to the
woman's eyes now.</p>

<p>"I don't know nothin' what you're talkin' about,
and I don't want to know, neither," she finished
coldly, turning squarely around in her seat.</p>

<p>Cordelia hesitated; then she stammered:</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if you think it's because your mother will
scold you, I can assure you that she will not. She
is very anxious to hear from you&mdash;that's all. She's
been so worried! She wants to know if you're doing
well, and all that."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about?" demanded the
woman, turning sharply back to Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;mother."</p>

<p>"My mother is&mdash;dead, Miss."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" gasped Cordelia. "You mean you
<i>aren't</i> Mrs. Lizzie Higgins&mdash;she that was Lizzie
Snow of Sunbridge, New Hampshire, who eloped
with Mr. Higgins and ran away to Texas years
ago?"</p>

<p>The woman laughed. Her face cleared. Whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
it was that she had feared&mdash;she evidently
feared it no longer.</p>

<p>"No, Miss. My name isn't 'Lizzie,' and it
wa'n't 'Snow,' and I never heard of Sunbridge,
New Hampshire."</p>

<p>"O dear!" quavered Cordelia. "Mrs. Snow
will be so sorry&mdash;that is, of course she'll be glad,
too; for you aren't&mdash;" With a little gasp of dismay
Cordelia pulled herself up before the words
were uttered, but not before their meaning was
quite clear to the woman.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she'll be glad, too, no doubt," she cut
in bitterly; "because I'm not exactly what a woman
would want for a lost daughter, now, am I?"</p>

<p>Cordelia blushed painfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please don't talk like that! I am
sure Mrs. Snow would be glad to find any one for
a daughter&mdash;she wants her so! And she's her&mdash;mother,
you know."</p>

<p>The woman's face softened.</p>

<p>"All right," she smiled, a little bitterly. "If I
find her I'll send her to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, will you? Thank you so much," cried
Cordelia. "And there are some others, too, that
I'm hunting for. Maybe you can find them&mdash;traveling
around so much as you do. If you've got a
little piece of paper and a pencil, I'll just write them
down, please."</p>

<p>Thus it happened that when the prairie schooners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
"sailed away" (again to quote Tilly), one of them
carried a bit of paper on which had been written
full instructions how to proceed should the wife
of its owner ever run across John Sanborn, Lizzie
Higgins, Lester Goodwin, or James Hunt.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was soon after this that the Happy Hexagons
and Mr. Tim, returning on horseback from a long
day on the range, met with a delay that would
prevent their reaching the ranch house until some
time after dark.</p>

<p>"Oh, goody! I don't care a bit," chuckled Genevieve,
when she realized the facts of the case.
"There is a perfectly glorious moon, and now you
can see the prairie by moonlight. And you never
really have seen the prairie until you do see it by
moonlight, you know!"</p>

<p>"But we have seen it by moonlight&mdash;right from
your steps," cried Tilly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but not the same as it will be out here&mdash;away
from the ranch house," cried Genevieve.
"You just wait! You'll see."</p>

<p>And they did wait. And they did see.</p>

<p>It did seem, indeed, that they never before had
really seen the prairie; they all agreed to that, as
they gazed in awed delight at the vast, silvery wonder
all about them, some time later.</p>

<p>"Why, it looks more than ever like the ocean,"
cried Bertha.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"That grass over there actually ripples like
water in the moonlight," declared Elsie.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose anything could be so beautiful,"
breathed Cordelia. "But, Genevieve, won't
Mrs. Kennedy be dreadfully worried, at our being
so late?"</p>

<p>Genevieve gave a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm afraid so," she admitted. "Still, she
has Father to comfort her, and he'll remind her that
Mr. Tim is with us, and that delays are always happening
on a day's run like ours."</p>

<p>"I wish she could see this beautiful sight herself,"
cried Alma. "She wouldn't blame us, then, for
going wild over it and not minding if we are a little
hungry."</p>

<p>Tilly, for once, was silent.</p>

<p>"Well?" questioned Genevieve, after a time,
riding up to her side.</p>

<p>"I don't know any one&mdash;only Quentina&mdash;who
could do justice to it," breathed Tilly. And, to
Genevieve's amazement, the moonlight showed a
tear on Tilly's cheek.</p>

<p>There was a long minute of silence. The
moon was very bright, yet the many swift-flying
clouds brought moments of soft darkness, and
cast weird shadows across the far-reaching
prairie.</p>

<p>"I think I smell a storm coming&mdash;sometime,"
sniffed Mr. Tim, his face to the wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be lovely to have it come while we
were out here," gurgled Tilly.</p>

<p>"Hardly!" rejoined Mr. Tim with emphasis.
"I reckon you needn't worry about that storm for
some hours yet. I'll have you all safely corralled
long before it breaks&mdash;never fear."</p>

<p>"I wasn't fearing. I was hoping," retorted Tilly
in a voice that brought a chuckle to the man's lips.</p>

<p>A moment later Mr. Tim stopped his horse and
pointed to the right.</p>

<p>"Do you see that black shadow over there?" he
asked Bertha Brown, who was nearest him.</p>

<p>"Yes. From a cloud, isn't it?" Bertha, too,
stopped to look.</p>

<p>"I think not. It's a bunch of cattle, I reckon.
I think I make out the guards riding round them."</p>

<p>"What is it, Mr. Tim?" Genevieve and the
other girls had caught up with them now.</p>

<p>"Cattle&mdash;over there. See?" explained Mr.
Tim, briefly.</p>

<p>At that moment the moon came out unusually
clear.</p>

<p>"I can see two men on horseback, passing each
other," cried Bertha.</p>

<p>Mr. Tim nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the guard. They ride around the bunch
in opposite ways, you know."</p>

<p>"Let's go nearer! I want to see," proposed Tilly,
trying to quiet the restless movements of her pony.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/gs03.jpg" width="313" height="366" alt="&quot;&#39;FOLLOW ME&mdash;QUICK!&#39; HE ORDERED&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;FOLLOW ME&mdash;QUICK!&#39; HE ORDERED&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;FOLLOW ME&mdash;QUICK!&#39; HE ORDERED&quot;</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>"I reckon not, Miss Tilly. A stampede ain't
what I'm looking for to amuse you all to-night."</p>

<p>"What's a stampede?" asked Tilly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Tim, look&mdash;quick!" Genevieve's voice
was urgent, a little frightened. But the man had
not needed that. With a sharp word behind his
teeth, he spurred his horse.</p>

<p>"Follow me&mdash;quick!" he ordered. And with a
frightened cry they obeyed.</p>

<p>Genevieve obeyed, too&mdash;but she looked back
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>The moon was very bright now. The black
shadow to the right had become a wedge-shaped,
compact, seething mass, sweeping rapidly toward
them. There was a rushing swish in the air, and
the sound of hoarse shouts. A few moments later
the maddened beasts swept across their path, well
to the rear.</p>

<p>"I'll answer your question, now, Miss Tilly,"
said Mr. Tim, as they reined in their horses and
looked backward at the shadowy mass. "That was
a stampede."</p>

<p>"But what will they do with them?" chattered
Cordelia, with white lips. "How can they ever
stop them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll head them off&mdash;get them to running
in a circle, probably, till they can quiet them
and make them lie down again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"And will they be all right&mdash;then?" shivered
Elsie.</p>

<p>"Hm-m; yes," nodded Mr. Tim, "&mdash;till the
next thing sets them going. Then they'll be again
on their feet, every last one of them&mdash;heads and
tails erect. Oh, they're a pretty sight then&mdash;they
are!"</p>

<p>"They must be," remarked Tilly. "Still&mdash;well,
I sha'n't ask you again what a stampede is&mdash;not
to-night."</p>

<p>Mr. Tim laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Tilly, 'tain't likely I could show you
one if you did. I don't always keep 'em so handy!
And now I reckon we'd better hit the trail for the
Six Star, and be right lively about it, too," he added,
"or we'll be having Mis' Kennedy out here herself
on a broncho after ye!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later a white-faced, teary-eyed little
woman at the Six Star Ranch was trying to get her
joyful arms around six girls at once.</p>

<p>It was the next morning, and just before Mr.
Tim's predicted storm broke, that the girls found
the injured man almost hidden in the tall grass near
the ranch house. They had gone out for a short
ride, but had kept near shelter owing to the threatening
sky. Tilly saw the man first.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, there's a man down there," she cried
softly. "He's hurt, I think."</p>

<p>Genevieve was off her horse at once. The man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
was found to be breathing, but apparently unconscious.
He lay twisted in a little huddled heap,
with one of his legs bent under him. He groaned
faintly when Genevieve spoke to him.</p>

<p>Genevieve was a little white when she straightened
up.</p>

<p>"I think we'll have to get a wagon, or something,
and two of the boys," she said. "I'll ride
back to the house if some of you girls will stay
here."</p>

<p>"We'll all stay," promised Cordelia; "only be
quick," she added, slipping from her pony's back,
and giving the reins to Bertha. "Maybe if I could
hold his poor head he'd be more comfortable."</p>

<p>Cautiously she sat down on the ground and lifted
the man's head to her lap. He groaned again
faintly, and opened his eyes. They were large and
dark. For a moment there was only pain in their
depths; then, gradually, there came a look of profound
amazement.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" he asked feebly.</p>

<p>"Sh! Don't talk. You are on the prairie. You
must have got hurt, some way."</p>

<p>He tried to move, and groaned again.</p>

<p>"Please be still," begged Cordelia. "You'll
make things worse. We've sent for help, and they'll
be here right away."</p>

<p>The man closed his eyes now. He did not speak
again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>It seemed a long time, but it was really a very
short one, before Genevieve came with Carlos and
Pedro and one of the ranch wagons. The man
groaned again, and grew frightfully white when
they lifted him carefully into the wagon. Then he
fainted. He was still unconscious when they
reached the ranch house.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>A MAN AND A MYSTERY</h3>


<p>August came. The first few days of the month
were particularly busy ones as some of the boys
were off to a round-up on the fifth, and Mr. Hartley
was going with them for a week. To the girls
the big four-horse wagon for the food and bedding&mdash;the
"wheeled house" that was to be home for
the boys&mdash;was always an object of great interest.
Then there was the excitement of the start on the
day itself, which this time was made particularly
momentous by the going of Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>The ranch house seemed very lonely without its
genial, generous-hearted owner, and everybody was
glad that he had promised to come back in a week.
Meanwhile, of course, there was "the man."</p>

<p>The man was he who had been found by the girls
in the prairie grass. He was still almost as much
of a mystery as ever. Mr. Hartley had insisted
upon his staying&mdash;and, indeed (though no bones
were broken), he was quite too badly injured to be
moved for a time. He was able now to sit in the
big comfortable chairs on the back gallery; and he
spent hours there every day, sometimes reading,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
more often sitting motionless, with his dark eyes
closed, and his hands resting on his crutches by his
side.</p>

<p>He had not seemed to care to talk of himself.
He had merely said that his horse had thrown him,
and that he had lain in the grass for some time before
he was found. He was quiet, had good manners,
and used good language. He said that his
name was John Edwards. He seemed deeply grateful
for all kindness shown him, but was plainly anxious
to be well enough to be on his way again. Mr.
Hartley, however, had won his promise to remain
till he himself returned from the round-up.</p>

<p>All the young people did their best to make the
injured man's time pass as pleasantly as possible;
and very often one or another of them might be
found reading to him, or playing a game of checkers
or chess with him.</p>

<p>It was on such an occasion that Cordelia Wilson,
at the conclusion of a game of checkers, found the
courage to say something that had long been on
her mind.</p>

<p>"Mr. Edwards, do&mdash;do you know Texas very
well?"</p>

<p>The man smiled a little.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cordelia, Texas is rather large, you
know."</p>

<p>Cordelia sighed almost impatiently.</p>

<p>"Dear me! I&mdash;I wish every one wouldn't always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
say that," she lamented. "It's so discouraging!"</p>

<p>"Dis&mdash;couraging?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when you're trying to find some one."</p>

<p>"Oh! And are you trying to find some one?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; four some ones."</p>

<p>"Well, I should think that might be difficult&mdash;in
Texas, unless you know where they are," smiled
the man.</p>

<p>"I don't; and that's what's the matter," sighed
Cordelia. "That's why I was going to ask you, to
see if you didn't know, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Ask <i>me?</i>"</p>

<p>"Yes. That is, if you had been around any&mdash;in
Texas. You see I ask everybody, almost. I
have to," she apologized a little wistfully. "And
even then it looks as if I should have to go back to
Sunbridge without finding one of them. And I'd
so hate to do that!"</p>

<p>The man started visibly.</p>

<p>"Go back&mdash;where?"</p>

<p>"To Sunbridge."</p>

<p>"Sunbridge&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sunbridge, New Hampshire; home, you know."</p>

<p>An odd expression crossed the man's face.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I didn't know," he said, after a moment.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't any of us ever tell you we were
from the East?" cried Cordelia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes, lots of times. But you never happened
to mention the town before, I think."</p>

<p>"Why, how funny!" murmured Cordelia.</p>

<p>The man did not speak. He seemed to have
fallen into a reverie. Cordelia stirred restlessly in
her seat.</p>

<p>"Did you say you would help me?" she asked
at last, timidly.</p>

<p>"Help you?" The man seemed to have forgotten
what she had been speaking of.</p>

<p>"Help me to find them, you know&mdash;those
people I'm looking for."</p>

<p>"Why, of course," laughed the man, easily.
"Who are&mdash;" He stopped abruptly. For the
second time an odd expression crossed his face.
"Are they&mdash;Sunbridge people?" he asked, stooping
to pick up a dried leaf from the gallery
floor.</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Edwards. There are four of them&mdash;three
men and one woman. They are John Sanborn,
Lester Goodwin, James Hunt, and Mrs. Lizzie
Higgins. Maybe you know some of them. Do
you?"</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cordelia,"&mdash;the man stopped a
minute, as he reached for a leaf still farther away&mdash;"is
that quite to be expected?" he asked then,
lightly.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," she sighed; "for, of course,
Texas <i>is</i> big. But if you would please just put their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
names down on paper same as the others have, that
would help a great deal."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," agreed the man, reaching into
his pocket and bringing out a little notebook not
unlike the minister's. "Now suppose you&mdash;you
give me those names again, Miss Cordelia."</p>

<p>"John Sanborn, Lester Goodwin, James Hunt,
and Mrs. Lizzie Higgins. And I am Cordelia Wilson,
you know. Just 'Sunbridge, New Hampshire,'
would reach me&mdash;if you found any of them."</p>

<p>"I'll remember&mdash;if I find any of them," murmured
the man, as he wrote the last name.</p>

<p>"And thank you so much!" beamed Cordelia.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. The man was
playing with his pencil.</p>

<p>"Did you say you were <i>asked</i> to find these
people?" he inquired at last, examining the lead
of his pencil intently.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And may I inquire who asked
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course! The people who belong to
them&mdash;who are so anxious for them to come back,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, then they want them?" The man was
still examining the point of his pencil.</p>

<p>"Indeed they do, Mr. Edwards," cried Cordelia,
glad to find her new audience so interested. "Mrs.
Lizzie Higgins eloped years ago, and her mother,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Mrs. Snow, is terribly worried. She's never heard
a word from her. Mrs. Granger is a widow, and
very poor. Her husband died last year. She hasn't
any one left but her cousin, Lester Goodwin, now,
and she so wishes she could find him. Lester's had
some money left him, but if he isn't found this year,
it'll go to some one else."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The man gave a short little laugh that
sounded not quite pleasant, as he lifted his head
suddenly. "I begin to see. Mrs. Granger thinks
if she had Lester, and Lester had the money, why
she'd get the money, too, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir&mdash;not exactly," objected Cordelia.
"You see, if he <i>isn't</i> found the money goes to <i>her</i>,
so she thinks she ought to make a special effort to
find him. She says she wouldn't sleep a wink if
she took all that money <i>without</i> trying to find him;
so she asked me. Of course the lawyers are hunting,
anyway."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" said the man again; but this time he
did not laugh. "Hm-m; well&mdash;are there any
fortunes left the other two?" he asked, after a
moment's silence. He had gone back to his pencil
point.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, sir," laughed Cordelia, a little ruefully.
"I'm afraid they won't think so. <i>They're</i> wanted
to <i>help</i> folks."</p>

<p>"To help folks!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You see John Sanborn's father is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
very poor, and he lives all alone in a little bit
of a house in the woods. He's called 'Hermit
Joe.'"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go on," bade the man, as Cordelia
stopped for breath. The man's voice was husky&mdash;perhaps
because he had stooped to pick up another
dried leaf.</p>

<p>"There isn't much more about him, only he's
terribly lonesome and wants his boy, he says. You
see, the boy ran away years and years ago. I don't
think that was very nice of him. Do you?"</p>

<p>There was no answer. The man sat now with
his hand over his eyes. Cordelia wondered if perhaps
she had tired him.</p>

<p>"And that's all," she said hurriedly; "only Sally
Hunt's brother, James. If he isn't found she'll
have to go to the Poor Farm, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Cordelia started nervously. The man had turned
upon her so sharply that his crutches fell to the
floor with a crash.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, I beg your pardon," she apologized,
springing to her feet. "I'm so afraid you were
asleep, and I startled you. I&mdash;I will go now. And&mdash;and
thank you ever so much for writing down
those names!"</p>

<p>The man shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>"Don't go," he begged. "You have not tired
me, and I like to hear you talk. Now sit down,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
please, and tell me all about these people&mdash;this
James Hunt's sister, and all the rest."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you really want to know about them?"
cried Cordelia, joyfully. "Then I will tell you;
for maybe it would help you find them, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe it would," agreed the man, in a
curiously vibrant voice, as Cordelia seated herself
again at his side. "Now talk."</p>

<p>And Cordelia talked. She talked not only then,
but several times after that, and she talked always
of Sunbridge. Mr. Edwards seemed so interested
in everything and everybody there, though specially,
of course, in the relatives of the four lost people
she was trying to find&mdash;which was natural, certainly,
thought Cordelia, inasmuch as he, too, was
going to search for them in the weeks to come.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards improved in health very rapidly
these days. He discarded his crutches, and seemed
feverishly anxious to test his strength on every occasion.
Upon Mr. Hartley's return from the
round-up, the injured man insisted that he was
quite well enough to go away; and, in spite of the
kind ranchman's protests, he did go the next day
after Mr. Hartley's return. Carlos drove him to
Bolo, and the Happy Hexagons stood on the ranch-house
steps and gave him their Texas yell as a
send-off, substituting a lusty "MR. EDWARDS"
for Genevieve's name at the end.</p>

<p>"That is the most convenient yell," chuckled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Tilly, as the ranch wagon with Carlos and Mr. Edwards
drove away. "It'll do for anything and
anybody. And didn't Mr. Edwards like it!"</p>

<p>"Of course he did! He couldn't help it," cried
Genevieve.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Edwards is a very nice man," observed
Cordelia, with emphasis, "and I wish he
could have stayed for the party."</p>

<p>"Why, of course he's a nice man," chimed in
the other girls, eyeing her earnest face a little curiously.</p>

<p>"Who said he wasn't?" laughed Tilly. "My!
but it is hot, isn't it?" she added, dropping into one
of the big wicker chairs near her.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course we have to have some warm
weather," bridled Genevieve, "else you'd be homesick
for New Hampshire!"</p>

<p>"The mean annual temperature of the country
near&mdash;" began Tilly, mischievously; but Genevieve
put her hands to her ears and fled.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The fourteenth of August was to be a gala occasion
at the Six Star Ranch, for there was to be a
supper and dance to entertain the friends from the
East.</p>

<p>"But where'll you get your guests?" demanded
Tilly, when she first heard of the plan. "Whom
can you have, 'way off here like this?&mdash;all will
please take notice that I said '<i>whom</i>'!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve laughed and tossed her head a little.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll have the boys here on the ranch, of
course, and Susie Billings, and some of the other
Bolo girls. We can't have Quentina, of course&mdash;Poor
thing! Isn't it a shame about that whooping
cough?&mdash;and Ned's got it, too, now, you know!&mdash;but
I think the Boyntons will come. Their ranch
is only thirty-five miles away, and they could stay
all night, of course."</p>

<p>"Only thirty-five miles away," repeated Tilly,
airily. "Of course nobody'd mind a little thing
like that, for a party!"</p>

<p>"No, they wouldn't&mdash;in Texas," retorted Genevieve.
"There's the Wetherbys, too. They live
five miles out from Bolo on the other side. Maybe
they'll come. We'll ask them, anyhow. Oh, we'll
have a party&mdash;never you fear!"</p>

<p>When the night of the fourteenth arrived, things
looked, indeed, very like "a party." Everywhere
were confusion and excitement, even to the saddle
room and blacksmith's shop, and to the two big
tents that were being put up for extra sleeping
quarters. Everywhere, too (Mrs. Kennedy declared),
were dishes heaped with chocolate candies.
Mr. Edwards, who had left the ranch only the day
before, had sent back by Carlos twenty-five pounds
of the best candy Bolo could supply; and the girls
had been lavish in its disposal.</p>

<p>Five Wetherbys and six Boyntons had arrived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
together with a dozen cowboys on horseback. Susie
Billings, minus her khaki and cartridges, looked the
picture of demureness in white muslin and baby-blue
ribbons. There were other pretty girls, too,
from Bolo, in white, and in pale pink and yellow.
And everywhere were the Happy Hexagons, wildly
excited, and delighted with it all.</p>

<p>The big hall and the living-room had been cleared
for dancing. The galleries and the long covered
way leading to the dining room had been decorated
with flowers and lanterns. The long table in the
dining-room was decorated, too, and would later be
loaded with all sorts of good things: sandwiches,
hot biscuits, tamales, cakes, and black coffee without
sugar. In the center of the table already there was
a huge round white something that called forth delighted
clappings from the Happy Hexagons as they
flocked in at seven o'clock to look at the table decorations.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a lovely cake," gurgled Tilly, "and
such a big one!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed mischievously.</p>

<p>"I'll give you the whole cake&mdash;if you'll cut it,"
she proposed.</p>

<p>With manifest alacrity Tilly reached for a knife.</p>

<p>"Done!" she cried.</p>

<p>Before the knife descended, Genevieve caught her
hand.</p>

<p>"Wait! Look here," she parleyed. Taking the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
knife, she thrust its point through the elaborate
white frosting, with two or three gentle taps.</p>

<p>"Why, it's hard!&mdash;hard as stone," ejaculated
Tilly, trying for herself.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> stone," laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Stone!" cried a chorus of unbelieving voices.</p>

<p>"Yes, stone&mdash;frosted with sugar and the whites
of eggs. Oh, if you'd lived in Texas as long as I
have you'd have seen them before," nodded Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Well, I've got my opinion of Texas cakes,
then," pouted Tilly, with saucy impertinence.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll change it later, I reckon&mdash;when
you see the real ones," rejoined Genevieve, comfortably,
as they left the dining-room.</p>

<p>There never had been, surely, such a party. All
the Happy Hexagons agreed to that. So, too, did
all the guests. Perhaps on no one's face was there
a look of anxious care except on Cordelia's. Possibly
Mr. Hartley noticed this look. At all events
he watched Cordelia rather closely, as the evening
advanced, particularly after he chanced to overhear
some of her remarks to his guests. Then he sought
his daughter.</p>

<p>"Dearie," he began in a low voice, leading her a
little to one side, "what in the world ails that little
Miss Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"Ails her! What do you mean? Is she sick?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think so; but she looks as if she'd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
got the weight of the whole outfit on her shoulders,
and she seems to be going 'round asking everybody
if they knew John somebody, or Lizzie somebody
else."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed merrily; but almost at once
she frowned and shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, I don't know, Father, what is the matter.
But Cordelia is capable of&mdash;anything, if once her
conscience is stirred. Why don't you ask her yourself?"</p>

<p>"I believe I will, dearie," he asserted at last.</p>

<p>Five minutes later he chanced to find Cordelia
without a partner.</p>

<p>"Miss Cordelia, will you accept an old man for
this dance?" he asked genially. "And shall we
sit it out, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you! I'd love to," cried Cordelia in
a relieved voice. "And I shall be so glad to
rest!"</p>

<p>"Tired&mdash;dancing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not dancing; that is&mdash;well&mdash;" She
stopped, and colored painfully.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley waited a moment, then observed with
a smile:</p>

<p>"You seem to be looking for some one to-night,
Miss Cordelia. Didn't I hear you asking Mr. Boynton
and Joe Wetherby if they knew John somebody
or other?"</p>

<p>Again a pink flush spread over Cordelia's face,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
"Yes, sir; I am looking for somebody&mdash;four
somebodies."</p>

<p>"You don't say! Found them yet?"</p>

<p>She shook her head. To the man's surprise and
distress, her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Hartley, and that's what's the trouble.
That's why I'm trying so hard to-night to ask all
these people&mdash;there's such a little time left!"</p>

<p>"Time&mdash;left?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'd like to tell you about it, please. I
think I may tell you. Of course I haven't said a
word to the girls, because the people&mdash;back in Sunbridge&mdash;didn't
want me to talk about it. I'm looking
for John Sanborn, Lester Goodwin, James Hunt,
and Mrs. Lizzie Higgins. They're all Sunbridge
people who came to Texas years ago, and are
lost."</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley gave a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p>"Did you say&mdash;Lester Goodwin was one?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Who wants him, and what for?"</p>

<p>Patiently Cordelia told him. She wore a hopeless
air. She had ceased, evidently, to expect anything
that was good.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley gave a low whistle. For a moment
he was silent, then he chuckled unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss Cordelia, if you hadn't looked so
far away for your pony you might have seen his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tracks nearer home, perhaps. As it happens, Lester
Goodwin is right here on the ranch."</p>

<p>"Here? Lester Goodwin?" gasped Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh, he isn't known by that name&mdash;he
preferred not to be. He came to me fourteen years
ago, and he's been here ever since. He said he
wanted to be a cowboy; that he'd always wanted
to be one ever since when, as a little boy, he used
to rope his rocking-horse with his mother's clothes-line.
His uncle had wanted him to be a teacher,
but he hated the sight of books; so when his uncle
died, he ran away and came here. He said there
wasn't anybody to care where he was, or what he
did; so I let him stay."</p>

<p>"And to think he's here now!"</p>

<p>"He certainly is. You see he came here because
he knew me once a little when I was in Sunbridge
visiting relatives, years ago, and he knew I had become
a ranchman in Texas. He begged so hard
that I should keep his secret that I've always kept
it. Besides, there was nothing to keep. Nobody
ever asked me, or suspected he was here."</p>

<p>"Why, how strange!" breathed Cordelia, with
shining eyes. "And only think how I've asked
everybody but you&mdash;and now I've found one of
them right here!"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;though we mustn't be too sure, of
course. We'll tell him; but maybe he won't want
to go back, even now. I reckon, however, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
when he hears of the money, Reddy won't mind
his real name being known."</p>

<p>"Reddy!" cried Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Oh!&mdash;I didn't tell you, did I?" smiled Mr.
Hartley. "Yes, Reddy is Lester Goodwin."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Hartley! And I never thought of
such a thing as asking <i>him!</i> I only looked for the
cowboys who were called 'John' or 'James' or
'Lester'&mdash;and there weren't many of those. And
so it's Reddy&mdash;why, I just can't believe it's true!"</p>

<p>"I reckon Reddy can't, either," laughed Mr.
Hartley. "And now we'll let you go back to your
dancing, my dear. I've already encountered at least
four pairs of glowering eyes unpleasantly pointed
in my direction. I'll go and find Reddy&mdash;or
rather, Mr. Lester Goodwin," he finished impressively,
as he rose to his feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>THE ALAMO</h3>


<p>Two days after the party at the ranch house,
Mr. Hartley made a wonderful announcement at
the dinner table.</p>

<p>"What do you say, young ladies, to a visit to
San Antonio?" he began.</p>

<p>"Father, could we? Do you mean we can?"
cried Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, that's just what I mean. It so happens
I've got business there, so I'm going to take
you home 'round by that way. We'll have maybe
a couple of days there, and we'll see something of
the surrounding country, besides. You know
Texas is quite a state&mdash;and you've seen mighty
little of it, as yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, girls, we'll see the Alamo!" cried Genevieve.
"Did you realize that?"</p>

<p>"Will we, truly?" chorused several rapturous
voices.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And what do you know about the Alamo,
young ladies?" smiled Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>"We know everything," answered Tilly, cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
"Mr. Jones's daughter, you know, was our
Latin teacher, and she had the History class, too.
Well, we couldn't even <i>think</i> Bunker Hill but what
she'd pipe up about the Alamo. Now I think Bunker
Hill is pretty good!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but we want to see the Alamo, just the
same," interposed Bertha, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Of course!" cried five emphatic girlish voices.</p>

<p>"All right," laughed Mr. Hartley. "You shall
see it, all of you&mdash;if the train will take us there;
and you'll see&mdash;well, you'll see a lot of other
things, too."</p>

<p>Cordelia stirred uneasily. The old anxious look
came back to her eyes. When dinner was over she
stole to Mr. Hartley's side.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hartley, please, shall we see an oil well?"
she asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Bless you, little lady, what do you know about
oil wells?" smiled the man, good-naturedly.
"You haven't got any of those to look up, have
you?"</p>

<p>To his dumbfounded amazement, she answered
simply:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;one."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be&mdash;well, just what is this proposition?"
he broke off whimsically.</p>

<p>"If you'll wait&mdash;just a minute&mdash;I'll get the
paper," panted Cordelia. "Mr. Hodges wrote
down the name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Very soon she had returned with the paper, and
Mr. Hartley saw the name. His face hardened, yet
his eyes were curiously tender.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, little girl, that this won't come out
quite so well as the Reddy affair&mdash;by the way,
Reddy left an extra good-by for you this morning.
He went away before you were up, you
know. He feels pretty grateful to you, Miss
Cordelia."</p>

<p>"But I didn't do anything, Mr. Hartley. I do
wish I could see Mrs. Granger when he gets there,
though. I&mdash;I'm afraid she doesn't like cowboys
much better than Mrs. Miller does."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Mr. Hartley was
scowling at the bit of paper in his hand.</p>

<p>"Did you say you <i>didn't</i> know where that oil
well was, Mr. Hartley?" asked Cordelia, timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't know where it is&mdash;and I reckon
there doesn't anybody else know, either," he answered
slowly. "I know where it <i>claims</i> to be,
and I know it is just one big swindle from beginning
to end."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," sighed the girl.</p>

<p>"So am I, my dear. I'm sorry for Mr. Hodges,
and lots of others that I know lost money in the
same thing. But it can't be helped now."</p>

<p>"Then there aren't any oil wells here at all in
Texas?" asked Cordelia, tearfully.</p>

<p>"Bless you, yes, child&mdash;heaps of them! You'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
see them, too, probably, before you leave the state.
But&mdash;you won't see this one."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," mourned Cordelia, again,
as sadly she took the bit of paper back to her room.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was not many days before the Happy Hexagons
said good-by to the ranch&mdash;a most reluctant
good-by. It was a question, however, which felt
the worst: Mammy Lindy, weeping on the gallery
steps, Mr. Tim and the boys, waving a noisy
good-by from their saddles, or Mrs. Kennedy and
the Happy Hexagons&mdash;the latter tearfully giving
their Texas yell with "THE RANCH" for the
final word to-day.</p>

<p>"I think I never had such a good time in all my
life," breathed Cordelia.</p>

<p>"I know I never did," choked Tilly. "Genevieve,
we can't ever begin to thank you for it
all!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't want you to," wailed Genevieve,
dabbing her eyes with her handkerchief. "I
reckon you haven't had any better time than I
have!"</p>

<p>Quentina was at the Bolo station; so, too, was
Susie Billings.</p>

<p>"O Happy Hexagons, Happy Hexagons, I just
had to come," chanted Quentina, standing some
distance away, and extending two restraining
hands, palms outward. "Don't kiss me&mdash;don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
come near me! I don't think I've got any whooping
germs about me, but we want to be on the safe
side."</p>

<p>"But, Quentina, how are you? How are all of
you?" cried Genevieve, plainly distressed. "I
think it's just horrid&mdash;staying off at arm's length
like this!"</p>

<p>"But you must, dear," almost sobbed Quentina.
"I wouldn't have you go through what we are going
through with at home for anything. Such a whoop&mdash;whoop&mdash;whooping
time!"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make a poem on it?" bantered
Tilly. "I should think 'twould make a splendid
subject&mdash;you could use such sonorous, resounding
words."</p>

<p>Quentina shook her head dismally.</p>

<p>"I couldn't. I tried it once or twice; but all I
could think of was 'Hark, from the tombs a doleful
sound'; then somebody would cough, and I just
couldn't get any further." Her voice was tragic
in spite of its drawl.</p>

<p>"You poor thing," sympathized Genevieve.
"But we&mdash;we're glad to <i>see</i> you, even for this
little, and even if we can't <i>feel</i> you! But, Quentina,
you'll write&mdash;sure?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll write," nodded Quentina, backing sorrowfully
away. "Good-by, Happy Hexagons,
good-by!"</p>

<p>"So that is your Quentina?" said Mr. Hartley<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
in a low voice, as the girls were waving their hands
and handkerchiefs. "Well, she <i>is</i> pretty."</p>

<p>"Oh, but she wasn't half so pretty to-day," regretted
Genevieve. "She looked so thin and tired.
I wanted to introduce you, Father, but I didn't
know how to&mdash;so far away."</p>

<p>"I should say not," laughed Mr. Hartley.
"'Twould have been worse than your high handshake
back East," he added, as he turned to speak
to Susie Billings, who had come up at that moment.</p>

<p>Susie Billings was in her khaki suit and cowboy
hat to-day, with the cartridge belt and holster; so,
as it happened, the last glimpse the girls had of
Bolo station was made picturesque by a vision of
"Cordelia's cowboy" (as Tilly always called
Susie) waving her broad-brimmed hat.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The trip to San Antonio was practically uneventful,
though it was certainly one long delight to the
Happy Hexagons, who never wearied of talking
about the sights and sounds of the wonderful country
through which they were passing.</p>

<p>"Well, this isn't much like Bolo; is it?" cried
Tilly, when at last they found themselves in the
handsome railroad station of the city itself. "I
shouldn't think Texas would know its own self
half the time&mdash;it's so different from itself all the
time!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/gs04.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="&quot;&#39;THERE, NOW&mdash;LOOK!&#39; SHE ADDED&quot;" title="&quot;&#39;THERE, NOW&mdash;LOOK!&#39; SHE ADDED&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;THERE, NOW&mdash;LOOK!&#39; SHE ADDED&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"That's all right, Tilly, and I think I know what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
you mean," laughed Genevieve; "but I wouldn't
advise you to give that sentence to Miss Hart as
your best example of logic."</p>

<p>"Well, I was talking about Texas," retorted
Tilly, saucily, "and there isn't anything logical
about Texas, that I can see. There, now&mdash;look!"
she added, as they reached the street. "Just tell
me if there's anything logical in that scene!" she
finished, with a wave of her hand toward the passing
throng.</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed, but her eyes, too, widened a
little as she stepped one side with the others, for a
moment, to watch the curious conglomeration of
humanity and vehicles before them.</p>

<p>In the street a luxurious limousine was tooting
for a ramshackle prairie schooner to turn to one
side. Behind the automobile plodded a forlorn
mule dragging a wagon-load of empty boxes. Behind
that came an army ambulance followed by an
electric truck. A handsome soldier on a restive bay
mare came next, and behind him a huge touring car
with a pompous black chauffeur. On either side of
the touring car rode a grinning boy on a mustang,
plainly to the discomfort of the pompous negro
and the delight of two pretty girls in white who
were in the low phaeton that followed. A bicycle
bell jangled sharply for a swarthy Mexican in a tall
peaked hat to get out of the way, and farther down
the street two solid-looking men in business suits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
were waiting for a pretty Mexican woman with a
rebosa-draped head to precede them into a car.
Behind them a huge negro woman wearing a red
bandana about her head, waited her turn. And
still behind her a severe-faced young woman in a
tailored suit was drawing her skirts away from two
almost naked pickaninnies.</p>

<p>"Well, no; perhaps it isn't really logical,"
laughed Genevieve. "But it's awfully interesting!"</p>

<p>"I chose one of the older hotels," said Mr. Hartley,
a little later, as he piloted his party through
the doorway of a fine old building.</p>

<p>"You couldn't have chosen a lovelier one, I'm
sure, Father," declared Genevieve, as she looked
about her with shining eyes.</p>

<p>Genevieve was even more convinced of this when,
just before dinner, in response to a summons from
Tilly's voice she stepped out on to the little balcony
leading from her room. The balcony overlooked an
inner court, and was hung with riotous moon-vines.
Down in the court a silvery fountain played among
palms and banana trees. Here and there a cactus
plant thrust spiny arms into the air. Somewhere
else queen's wreath and devil's ivy made a tiny
bower of loveliness. While everywhere were electric
lights and roses, matching one against the other
their brilliant hues.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, I&mdash;I think I'm going to c-cry,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
wailed Tilly's sobbing voice from the adjoining
balcony.</p>

<p>"Cry!&mdash;when it's all so lovely!" exclaimed
Genevieve.</p>

<p>Tilly nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes. That's why I want to," she quavered.
"Honestly, Genevieve, if I stay here long I shall be
writing poetry like Quentina&mdash;I know I shall!"</p>

<p>"If you do, just let me read it, that's all," retorted
Genevieve, saucily. "Where's Cordelia?"</p>

<p>"Off somewhere with Elsie and Bertha. She
got dressed early&mdash;but I sha'n't get dressed at all
if I don't go about it."</p>

<p>At that moment there was the sound of a scream,
then the patter of running feet in the court below.</p>

<p>"Why, there they are now," cried Genevieve,
leaning over the railing. "Girls, girls!" she called,
regardless of others in the court. "Look up here!
What's the matter?"</p>

<p>The girls stopped, and looked up. Cordelia, only,
cast an apprehensive glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"It's an alligator in the fountain in the other
court," explained Elsie. "Bertha said she heard
there was one there, and so we went to see&mdash;and
we found out."</p>

<p>"I should say we did," shuddered Cordelia, still
with her head turned backward. "I sha'n't sleep
a wink to-night&mdash;I know I sha'n't!"</p>

<p>"An alligator&mdash;really?" cried Tilly. "Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
I'm going to hurry and get ready so I can see him
before dinner," she finished, as she whisked into
her room.</p>

<p>Dinner that night, in the brilliantly lighted,
flower-decked dining-room was an experience never
to be forgotten by the girls.</p>

<p>"I didn't suppose there were such bea-<i>u</i>-tiful
dresses in the world," sighed Elsie, looking about
her.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley smiled.</p>

<p>"I reckon you'd think so, Miss Elsie," he said,
"if you could see the place when it's in full swing.
It's too early yet for the real tourist season, I imagine.
Anyhow, there aren't so many people here as
I've always seen before."</p>

<p>"Well, I shouldn't ask it to be any nicer, anyway,"
declared Bertha; and the rest certainly
agreed with her.</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning the Happy
Hexagons and Mr. Hartley started out sight-seeing.
Mrs. Kennedy was too tired to go, she said.</p>

<p>"I'll let business slip for an hour or two," Mr.
Hartley remarked as they left the hotel; "at all
events, until I get you young people started."</p>

<p>"Hm-m; you mean, to&mdash;the Alamo?" hinted
Genevieve, with merry eyes.</p>

<p>"Sure, dearie! The Alamo it shall be," smiled
her father. "Then to-morrow I'll take you to Fort
Sam Houston where there are <i>live</i> soldiers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, is there an army post here, truly?" cried
Tilly.</p>

<p>"Only the largest in the country," answered the
Texan, proudly.</p>

<p>"Really? Oh, how splendid! I just love soldiers!"</p>

<p>"Really?" mimicked Mr. Hartley, mischievously.
"They'll be pleased to know it, I'm sure, Miss
Tilly."</p>

<p>The others laughed. Tilly blushed and shrugged
her shoulders; but she asked no more questions
about Fort Sam Houston for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>"Now where's the place&mdash;the really, truly
place?" demanded Cordelia, in an awed voice,
when the party had reached the Alamo Plaza.</p>

<p>"The place&mdash;the real place, Miss Cordelia," replied
Mr. Hartley, "where the fight occurred, was
in a court over there; and the walls were pulled
down years ago. But this little chapel was part of
it, and this is what everybody always looks at and
talks about. The relics are inside. We'll go in
and see them, if you like."</p>

<p>"If we like!" cried Genevieve, fervently. "Just
as if we didn't want to see everything&mdash;every
single thing there is to see!" she finished, as her
father led the way into the dim interior under the
watchful eyes of the caretaker.</p>

<p>Even Tilly, for a moment, was silenced in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
hush and somberness of the place. Genevieve stole
to her father's side. Mr. Hartley, with bared head,
was wearing a look of grave reverence.</p>

<p>"You appreciate it, don't you, Father?" she
said softly. "You have always talked such a lot
about it."</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"I don't see how any one can help appreciating
it," he rejoined, after a moment, looking up at the
narrow, iron-barred windows. "Why, Genevieve,
this is our Bunker Hill, you know."</p>

<p>"I know," she said soberly. "How many was
it? I've forgotten."</p>

<p>"About one hundred and eighty on the inside&mdash;here;
and all the way from two to six thousand on
the outside&mdash;accounts differ. But it was thousands,
anyway, against one hundred and eighty&mdash;and
it lasted ten days or more."</p>

<p>Genevieve shuddered.</p>

<p>"And they all&mdash;died?"</p>

<p>"Every one&mdash;of the soldiers. There was a
woman and a young child and a negro servant left
to tell the tale."</p>

<p>"That's what it means on the monument, isn't
it?" murmured Genevieve. "'Thermopyl&aelig; had
its messenger of defeat: the Alamo had none.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her father. "I've always wondered
what Davy Crockett would have said to that. You
know he was here."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wasn't he the one who said, 'Be sure you are
right, then go ahead'?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And he went ahead&mdash;straight to his
death, here."</p>

<p>Genevieve's eyes brimmed with tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, it does make one want to be good and
brave and true, doesn't it, Father?"</p>

<p>"I reckon it ought to, little girl," he smiled
gently.</p>

<p>"It does," breathed Genevieve. A moment later
she crossed to Tilly's side.</p>

<p>Tilly welcomed her with subdued joyousness.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, please, <i>please</i> mayn't we get out
of this?" she begged. "Honestly, I feel as if I
were besieged myself in this horrid tomb-like
place. And&mdash;and I like live soldiers so much
better!"</p>

<p>Genevieve gave her a reproachful glance, but in a
moment she suggested that perhaps they had better
go.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that was lovely," she sighed, as they
came out into the bright sunshine. "The caretaker
told me they call it the 'Cradle of Liberty,'
here; and I don't wonder."</p>

<p>Tilly uptilted her chin&mdash;already the sunshine
had brought back her usual gayety of spirits.</p>

<p>"Dear me! what a lot of cradles Liberty must
have had! You know Faneuil Hall in Boston is
<i>one</i>. Only think how far the poor thing must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
traveled between naps if she tried to sleep in all her
cradles!"</p>

<p>Even Genevieve laughed&mdash;but she sighed reproachfully,
too.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tilly, how you can turn poetry into prose&mdash;sometimes!"
Then she added wistfully: "How
I wish I could see this Plaza on San Jacinto Day!"</p>

<p>"What is that?" demanded Tilly.</p>

<p>"The twenty-third of April. They have the
Battle of the Flowers in the Plaza here, in front
of the Alamo. I've always wanted to see that."</p>

<p>"Hm-m; well, I might not mind that kind of
a battle myself," laughed Tilly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>TILLY CROSSES BRIDGES</h3>


<p>In the afternoon the young people again started
out to explore the town. This time Mr. Hartley
was not with them.</p>

<p>"But are you quite sure you won't get lost?"
Mrs. Kennedy demurred anxiously, as Genevieve
was putting on her hat.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," returned Genevieve, with calm
truthfulness and a merry smile. "But, dearie, it's
daylight and there are six of us. What if we do
get lost? We've got tongues in our heads, and we
know the name of our hotel and of the street it's
on."</p>

<p>"Very well," sighed Mrs. Kennedy. Then, with
sudden spirit she added: "Dear me, Genevieve! I
shall be glad if ever we get back to Sunbridge and
I have you to myself all quiet again. I'm afraid
you'll never, never settle down to just plain living
after these irresponsible weeks of one long playday."</p>

<p>It was Genevieve's turn now to sigh.</p>

<p>"I know, Aunt Julia. It will be hard, won't it?"
she admitted. Then, with a quick change of manner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
she observed airily: "As if anything could be
nicer than learning to cook, and keeping my stockings
mended! Why, Aunt Julia!" The next moment,
with a breezy kiss, she was gone.</p>

<p>It was a delightful afternoon that the girls spent
rambling about the curiously interesting old town,
which&mdash;Cordelia impressively informed them&mdash;was
the third oldest in the United States. They
tried to see it all, but they did not succeed in this,
of course. They did stand in delighted wonder before
the San Fernando Cathedral with its square,
cross-tipped towers; and they did wander for an
entrancing hour in the old Mexican Quarter, with its
picturesque houses and people, its fascinating chili
and tamale stands, and its narrow, twisting streets,
which Genevieve declared were almost as bad as
Boston.</p>

<p>"Boston!" bridled Tilly, instantly. "Why,
Boston's tiniest, crookedest streets are great wide
boulevards compared to these! Besides, when we
are in Boston we don't have to cross a river every
time we turn around."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," retorted Genevieve,
warmly. "Just try to go over to Cambridge or
Charlestown and see. I'm sure I think Boston's
got lots of bridges."</p>

<p>Tilly sniffed her disdain.</p>

<p>"Pooh! You're <i>leaving</i> Boston when you cross
those bridges, Genevieve Hartley, and you know it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
But just look at them here! We haven't stirred
once out of San Antonio, and I think I've crossed
five bridges in the last seven minutes. I can imagine
those old fellows who built this town getting tired
of building houses, and saying: 'And now let's stop
and build a bridge for the fun of it!'"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You've won, Tilly. I'll give up," she chuckled.
"I hadn't meant to tell you; but there <i>are</i> thirteen
miles of river twisting in and out through the city,
and&mdash;there <i>are</i> seventeen bridges."</p>

<p>"Where did you find out all that?" demanded
Tilly, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"In a guidebook that I saw last night at the
hotel. It's the same one, I reckon, that Cordelia's
been giving all her information from," said Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Hm-m;" commented Tilly. "Now I <i>know</i>
I've crossed five bridges in the last seven minutes!"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't care if there were forty miles
of river and fifty bridges," retorted Genevieve, "if
they'd all have such lovely green banks and dear
little boats!"</p>

<p>"Nor I," agreed two or three emphatic voices.</p>

<p>Everywhere and at every turn the girls found
something of interest, something to marvel at.
When tired of walking they boarded a car; and
when tired of riding, they got off and walked.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, folks seem to have a choice of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
houses to live in," observed Tilly, her eyes on a
quaint little white bungalow surrounded by heuisach
and mesquite trees.</p>

<p>"Yes, they do," laughed Genevieve&mdash;Genevieve
was looking at the next one to it: an old-fashioned
colonial mansion set far back from the street,
with a huge pecan tree standing guard on each
side.</p>

<p>"Well, seems to me just now a hotel would look
the nicest of anything," moaned Cordelia, wearily.
"Girls, I just can't go another step&mdash;unless it's
toward home," she finished despairingly.</p>

<p>"Me, too," declared Tilly. "I'm just plum
locoed, I'm that tired! Say we hit the trail for the
hotel right now. Come on; I'm ready!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed, but she eyed Tilly a little
curiously.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose Sunbridge will say to
your new expressions &agrave; la the wild and woolly
West?" she queried.</p>

<p>"Just exactly what they said to you, Miss Genevieve,"
bantered Tilly.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Genevieve's were <i>natural</i>," cut in
Bertha, with meaning emphasis.</p>

<p>"All the more reason why mine should be more
interesting, then," retorted Tilly, imperturbably.
And with a laugh Bertha and Genevieve gave it up,
as with tired but happy faces, they set out for the
hotel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>At breakfast the next morning, Mr. Hartley announced
cheerily:</p>

<p>"We'll do the parks, to-day, and the Hot Sulphur
Well and Hotel; and finish with dress parade at
Fort Sam Houston."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;what about your business?" asked Genevieve.</p>

<p>Mr. Hartley laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all&mdash;done," he answered; then, as
the puzzled questioning still remained in her eyes,
he added, a little shamefacedly: "You see, there
wasn't much business, to tell the truth, dearie. I
reckon my real business was to show off the state
of Texas to our young Easterners here."</p>

<p>"You darling!" cried Genevieve, rapturously,
while all the rest of the Happy Hexagons stumbled
and stuttered over their vain attempts at thanking
him.</p>

<p>"I declare! I wish we could give him our Texas
yell, right here," chuckled Tilly, turning longing
eyes about the dining-room. "We would end with
'Mr. Hartley,' of course."</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Cordelia, in open horror.</p>

<p>"What is the Hot Sulphur Well, Mr. Hartley,
please?" asked Elsie, who had not heard Tilly's
remark.</p>

<p>"You'll have to ask some one who's been cured
by it," laughed the man. "They say there are
plenty that have been."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you suppose it looks any like an oil well?"
ventured Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Sounds a bit hot, seems to me, for to-day,"
giggled Tilly. "I think I shall like the parks better."</p>

<p>"All right; we'll let you do the parks&mdash;<i>all</i> of
them," cooed Genevieve, wickedly. "There are
only twenty-one, you know, my dear."</p>

<p>"Genevieve Hartley, if you remember your lessons
next year one half as well as you have that
abominable guidebook, you'll be at the head of your
class!" remarked Tilly, severely, as the others rose
from the table, with a laugh.</p>

<p>It was another long, happy day. The parks, as
Tilly had predicted, proved to be cooler than the
Hot Sulphur Well, and they certainly were more
enjoyable, even though only two of Genevieve's announced
twenty-one were visited&mdash;Brackenridge
Park, and San Pedro Park. It was the former that
Cordelia enjoyed the most, perhaps, for it was there
that she saw her much-longed-for buffalo. Tired,
but still enthusiastic, they reached the hotel in
time to dress for the visit to Fort Sam Houston,
upon which Mrs. Kennedy was to accompany
them.</p>

<p>Getting dressed was, however, a grand flurry of
excitement, for time and space were limited; and
there was not one of the Happy Hexagons who did
not feel that on this occasion, at least, every curl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and ribbon and shoe-tie must display a neatness that
was military in its precision.</p>

<p>Perhaps only Elsie of all the girls wept over the
matter. Her eyes were red when she knocked at
Genevieve's door.</p>

<p>"Why, Elsie!"</p>

<p>"Genevieve, I've come to say&mdash;I can't go,"
choked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Why, Elsie, are you sick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; it's&mdash;clothes. Genevieve, I simply
haven't anything to wear."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, dear, of course you have! We don't
have to dress much for this thing. Where's your
white linen or your tan or your blue?"</p>

<p>"The white is too soiled, and the other two have
worn places that show."</p>

<p>"But there's your chambray&mdash;that isn't worn."</p>

<p>Elsie shook her head.</p>

<p>"But I can't&mdash;that, truly, Genevieve. It's got
worse and worse every day, until now <i>anybody</i> can
tell Cora and Clara apart!"</p>

<p>Genevieve choked back a laugh. She was frowning
prodigiously when Elsie looked up.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Elsie, I've got just the thing," she
cried. "Wear my white linen&mdash;it's perfectly fresh,
and 'twill fit you, I'm sure."</p>

<p>Elsie's face turned scarlet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve! I wouldn't&mdash;I couldn't! I'd
never, never do such an awful thing," she gasped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
"Why, what <i>would</i> Aunt Kate say?&mdash;my wearing
your clothes like that! Oh, I never thought of your
taking it that way! Never mind&mdash;I'll fix something,"
she choked, as she turned and fled down
the hall, leaving a distressed and almost an angry
Genevieve behind her.</p>

<p>For some minutes Genevieve busied herself with
her own toilet, jerking hooks and ribbons into place
with unnecessary force; then she turned despairingly
to Mrs. Kennedy, whose room she was sharing.</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia, what's the use of having anything
to give, if folks won't take it when you give it?"
she demanded, irritably.</p>

<p>"Not having followed your thoughts for the last
five minutes, my dear, I fear I'm unable to give
you a very helpful answer," smiled Mrs. Kennedy,
serenely. And Genevieve, remembering Elsie's
shamed, red face, decided suddenly that Elsie's
secret was not hers to tell.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mr. Hartley marshaled his
party for the start.</p>

<p>"You're a brave sight," he declared, smiling
into the bright faces about him. "You're a mighty
brave sight; and I'll leave it to anybody if even
the boys in line to-day will make a finer show!"</p>

<p>The Happy Hexagons laughed and blushed and
courtesied prettily; and only Genevieve knew that
the smile on Elsie's face was a little forced&mdash;Elsie
was wearing the green chambray.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an awed "Oh-h!" of wonder and
admiration when Mr. Hartley's party came in
sight of the great parade grounds at Fort Sam
Houston. There was a still deeper, longer, louder
"Oh-h-h!" when, sitting at one end of the grounds,
the girls heard the first stirring notes of the band.</p>

<p>To the Hexagon Club it was a most wonderful
sight&mdash;those long lines of men moving with such
perfect precision. Fresh from the Alamo as the
girls were, with the story of that dreadful slaughter
in their ears&mdash;to them it almost seemed that there
before them marched the brave men who years ago
had given up their lives so heroically in the little
chapel.</p>

<p>It was Tilly who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do just love soldiers," she cried, with a
hurried glance sideways to make sure that Mr.
Hartley in the next carriage could not hear her.
"Don't you, Genevieve?" But Genevieve was too
absorbed to answer.</p>

<p>A little later the band played "The Star-spangled
Banner," and there sounded the signal gun
for the lowering of the colors. In the glorious
excitement of all this, even Tilly herself forgot to
talk.</p>

<p>After dress parade a certain Major Drew, who
knew Mr. Hartley, came up and was duly presented
to the ladies. He in turn presented the officer of
the day, who looked, to the Happy Hexagons, very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
handsome and imposing in sword and spurs. After
this, at Major Drew's invitation, there was a visit
to the officers' quarters, and on the Major's broad
gallery there was a cooling refreshment of lemonade
and root beer before the drive back to the hotel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>"BERTHA'S ACCIDENT"</h3>


<p>It had been decided that the party would go to
New Orleans from San Antonio, and then from
there by boat to New York.</p>

<p>"It'll make a change from car-riding, and a
very pleasant one, I'm thinking," Mr. Hartley had
said; and the others had enthusiastically agreed
with him.</p>

<p>It was on the five-hundred-and-seventy-two mile
journey from San Antonio to New Orleans that
something happened. In the Chronicles of the
Hexagon Club it fell to Genevieve to tell the story;
and this is what she wrote:</p>

<p>"It seems so strange to me that we should have
traveled so many thousands of miles on the railroad
without anything happening; and then, just
on the last five hundred (we are going to take the
boat at New Orleans)&mdash;to have it happen.</p>

<p>"We have had all sorts of amusing experiences,
of course, losing trains, and missing connections;
but nothing like this. Even when we had to take
that little bumpy accommodation for a few hours,
and it was so accommodating it stopped every few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
minutes 'to water the horses,' as dear Tilly said,
nothing happened&mdash;though, to be sure, we almost
did get left that time we all (except Aunt Julia)
got off and went to pick flowers while our train
waited for a freight to go by. But we didn't get
quite left, and we did catch it. (Dear Tilly says
we could have caught it, anyway, even if it had
started, and that we shouldn't have had to walk
very fast, at that! Tilly does make heaps of fun
of all our trains except the fast ones on the main
lines. And I don't know as I wonder, only I'd
never tell her that, of course&mdash;that is, I <i>wouldn't</i>
have told her before, perhaps.)</p>

<p>"Well, where was I? Oh, I know&mdash;on the
sidetrack. (I had to laugh here, for it occurred to
me that that was just where I was in the story&mdash;on
a sidetrack! I'm not telling what I started out
to tell at all. It's lucky we can each take all the
room we want, though, in these Chronicles.)</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell it now, really, though I'm still so
shaky and excited my hand trembles awfully. It
was in the night, a little past twelve o'clock that it
happened. I was lying in my berth above Elsie's,
and was wide-awake. I had been thinking about
Father. He has been such a dear all the way. I
was thinking what a big, big dear he was, when IT
happened.</p>

<p>"Yes, I put IT in capitals on purpose, and I
reckon you would, if suddenly the car you were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
riding in began to sway horribly and bump up and
down, and then stop right off short with a bang
that flung you into the middle of the aisle! And
that's what ours did.</p>

<p>"For a minute, of course, I was too dazed to
know what had happened. But the next moment I
heard a scared voice wail right in my ear:</p>

<p>"'Girls, it's an accident&mdash;I know it's an accident!
I told you we should have an accident&mdash;and
to think I took off my shoes to-night for the
very first time!'</p>

<p>"I knew then. It was Bertha, and it was an
accident. And, do you know? I'm ashamed to
tell it, but the first thing I did right there and then
was to laugh&mdash;it seemed so funny about Bertha's
shoes, and to hear her say her usual 'I told you
so!' But the next minute I began to realize what
it all really meant, and I didn't laugh any more.</p>

<p>"All around me, by that time, were frightened
cries and shouts, and I was so worried for Father
and all the rest. I struggled, and tried to get up;
and then I heard Father's voice call: 'Genevieve,
Genevieve, where are you? Are you all right?'
Oh, nobody will ever know how good that dear
voice sounded to me!</p>

<p>"We called for Aunt Julia, then, and for the
girls; but it was ever so long before we could find
them. We weren't all together, anyway, and the
crash had separated us more than ever. Besides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
everybody everywhere all over the car was crying
out by that time, and trying to find folks, all in the
dark.</p>

<p>"We found Aunt Julia. She was almost under
the berth near me; but she was so faint and dazed
she could not answer when we first called. I was
all right, and so were Cordelia and Bertha, only
Bertha bumped her head pretty hard afterwards,
looking for her shoes. Elsie Martin and Alma
Lane were a little bruised and bumped, too; but
they declared they could move all their legs and
arms.</p>

<p>"We hadn't any of us found Tilly up to that
time; but when Elsie said that (about being able
to move all her legs and arms), I heard a little faint
voice say 'You talk as if you were a centipede,
Elsie Martin!'</p>

<p>"'Tilly!' I cried then. 'Where are you?' The
others called, too, until we were all shouting frantically
for Tilly. We knew it must be Tilly for
nobody but Tilly Mack could have made that
speech!</p>

<p>"At last we found her. She was wedged in under
a broken seat almost at our feet. It was at the forward
end of the car&mdash;the only part that seemed
to be really smashed. She could not crawl out, and
we could not pull her out. She gave a moaning
little cry when Father tried to.</p>

<p>"'I guess&mdash;some of my legs and arms don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
go,' she called out to us with a little sob in her
voice.</p>

<p>"We were crazy then, of course&mdash;all of us;
and we all talked at once, and tried to find out just
where she was hurt. The trainmen had come by
this time with lanterns, and were helping every one
out of the car. Then they came to us and Tilly.</p>

<p>"And we were so proud of Tilly&mdash;she was so
brave and cheery! I never found out before what
her nonsense was for, but I did find it out then. It
was the only thing that kept us all from going just
wild. She said such queer little things when they
were trying to get her out, and she told them if
there was any one hurt worse than she to get them
out first. She told Father that she knew now just
how Reddy felt when his broncho went see-saw up
in the air, because that was what her berth did.</p>

<p>"Well, they got the poor dear out at last, and a
doctor from the rear car examined her at once.
Her left arm was broken, and she had two or three
painful bruises. Of course that was bad&mdash;but not
anywhere near so bad as it might have been, and we
were all so relieved. The doctor did what he could
for her, then we all made ourselves as comfortable
as possible while we waited for the relief train.</p>

<p>"We found out then about the wreck, and the
chief thing we could find out anywhere was what a
'fortunate' wreck it was! The engine and six cars
went off the track on a curve. Just ahead was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
steep bank with a river below it, and of course it
<i>was</i> fortunate that we did not go down that. No
one was killed, and only a few much injured. The
car ahead and ours were the only ones that were
smashed any. Yes, I suppose it was a 'fortunate
wreck'&mdash;but I never want to see an unfortunate
one. Certainly we all felt pretty thankful that we
had come out of it as well as we did.</p>

<p>"The relief train came at last, and took us to the
next city, and to-day we are started on our journey
once again. We expect to reach New Orleans to-night,
and take the boat for New York Saturday.
We all feel a little stiff and sore, but of course dear
Tilly feels the worst. But she tries to be just as
bright and smiling as ever. She looks pretty white,
though, and what the storybooks call 'wan,' I
reckon. She says, anyhow, she wishes she <i>were</i> a
centipede&mdash;in <i>arms</i>&mdash;because perhaps then she
wouldn't miss her left one so much, if she had
plenty more of them. There seems to be such a
lot of things she wants her left arm to do. The
doctor says it wasn't a <i>bad</i> break&mdash;as if any break
could be <i>good!</i></p>

<p>"And here endeth my record of 'Bertha's accident'&mdash;as
Tilly insists upon calling it, until she's
made Bertha almost ready to cry over it."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Owing to the delay of the accident, Mr. Hartley
and his party had only one day in New Orleans before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the boat sailed; but they made the most of
that, for they wanted to see what they could of the
quaint, picturesque city.</p>

<p>"We'll take carriages, dearie. We won't walk
anywhere," said Mr. Hartley to Genevieve that
morning. "In the first place, Mrs. Kennedy and
Miss Tilly couldn't, and the rest of us don't want
to. We can see more, too, in the short space of
time we have."</p>

<p>So in carriages, bright and early Friday morning,
the party started out to "do" New Orleans, as
Genevieve termed it. Leaving the "American portion,"
where were situated their hotel and most of
the other big hotels and business houses of American
type, they trailed happily along through Prytania
Street and St. Charles Avenue to the beautiful
"Garden District" which they had been warned
not to miss. They found, indeed, much to delight
them in the stately, palatial homes set in the midst
of exquisitely kept lawns and wonderful groves of
magnolia and oak. Quite as interesting to them
all, however, was the old French or Latin Quarter
below Canal Street, where were the Creole homes
and business houses. Here they ate their luncheon,
too, in one of the curious French restaurants,
famous the world over for its delicious dishes.</p>

<p>With the disappearance of the last mouthful on
her plate, Tilly drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"I've always heard Creoles were awfully interesting,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
she sighed. "Do you know&mdash;I don't think
I'd mind much being a Creole myself!"</p>

<p>"You look so much like one, too," laughed Genevieve,
affectionately, patting the soft, fluffy red hair
above the piquant, freckled little face.</p>

<p>At five o'clock that afternoon a tired but happy
party reached the hotel in time to rest and dress
for dinner.</p>

<p>"Well," sighed Genevieve, "I'd have liked a
week here, but a day has been pretty good. We've
seen enough 'Quarters' to make a 'whole,' and the
Cathedral, and dozens of other churches, and we've
driven along those lovely lakes with the unpronounceable
names; and now I'm ready for dinner."</p>

<p>"And we saw a statue&mdash;the Margaret Statue,"
cut in Cordelia, anxiously. "You know it's the
<i>first</i> statue ever erected to a woman's memory in
the United States. We wouldn't want to forget
that!"</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to," retorted Genevieve,
perversely. "It's only so much the worse for the
United States&mdash;that it wasn't done before!"</p>

<p>"I think Genevieve is going to be a suffragette,"
observed Tilly, cheerfully, as they trooped into the
hotel together.</p>

<p>It was from New Orleans that Cordelia Wilson
wrote a letter to Mr. William Hodges. She had
decided that it would be easier to write her bad
news than to tell it. Then, too, she disliked to keep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the old man any longer in suspense. She made her
letter as comforting as she could.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. William Hodges, Sir</span>:&mdash;" she wrote.
"I am very sorry to have to tell you that I have
looked, but cannot find your oil well anywhere. I
did find a man who had heard about it, but he said
there wasn't any well at all like what the Boston
man told you there was. He said it was a bad
swindle and he knew many others who had lost
their money, too, which I thought would please you.
O dear, no, I don't mean that, of course. I only
mean that you might like to know that others besides
you hadn't known any more than to put money
in it, too. (That doesn't sound quite right yet,
but perhaps you know what I mean.)</p>

<p>"I hope you won't feel too bad about it, Mr.
Hodges. I saw some oil wells when we came
through Beaumont, and I am quite sure you would
not like them at all. They are not one bit like
Bertha's aunt's well on her farm, with the bucket.
In fact, they don't look like wells at all, and I never
should have known what they were if Mr. Hartley
had not told me. They are tall towers <i>standing up</i>
out of the ground instead of stone holes sunk down
in the ground. (It is just as if you should call the
cupola on your house your cellar&mdash;and you know
how queer that would be!) I saw a lot of them&mdash;oil
wells, not cupolas, I mean&mdash;and they looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
more like a whole lot of little Eiffel Towers than
anything else I can think of. (If you will get your
grandson, Tony, to show you the Eiffel Tower in
his geography, you will see what I mean.) Mr.
Hartley says they <i>do</i> bore for them&mdash;wells, I
mean, not Eiffel Towers&mdash;and so I suppose they
do go down before they go up.</p>

<p>"I saw the wells on the way between San Antonio
and New Orleans. One was on fire. (Just
think of a well being on fire!) Of course we were
riding through a most wonderful country, anyway.
We saw a great many things growing besides oil
wells, too, as you must know&mdash;rice, and cotton,
and tobacco, and sugar cane, and onions, and quantities
of other things. I picked some cotton bolls.
(I spelt that right. This kind isn't b-a-ll.) I am
sending you a few in a little box. It takes 75,000
of them to make one bale of cotton, so I'm afraid
you couldn't make even a handkerchief out of these.</p>

<p>"I am so sorry about the oil well, but I did the
best that I could to find it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>THE GOLDEN HOURS</h3>


<p>Long before ten o'clock Saturday morning&mdash;the
hour for sailing&mdash;Mr. Hartley and his party
were on board the big steamship which was to take
them to New York. Here, again, new sensations
and new experiences awaited the Happy Hexagons,
not one of whom had ever been on so large a boat.</p>

<p>"I declare, I do just feel as if I was going
abroad," breathed Cordelia, in an awestruck voice,
as she crossed the gangplank.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sure we <i>are</i>, almost," exulted Genevieve.
"We're going to have a hundred hours of
it. You know that little pamphlet that told about it
called it 'a hundred golden hours at sea.' Oh, Cordelia,
only think&mdash;one hundred golden hours!"</p>

<p>"You'll think it's a thousand, if you happen to
be seasick," groaned Tilly. (Tilly was looking
rather white to-day.) "And they won't be golden
ones, either&mdash;they'll be <i>lead</i> ones. I know because
I've been to Portland when it's rough."</p>

<p>"Well, we aren't going to be seasick," retorted
Genevieve, with conviction. "We're just going to
have the best time ever. See if we don't!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, dearie," said Mr. Hartley, hurrying up at
that moment, "I engaged one of the suites for Mrs.
Kennedy, and I think Miss Tilly had better be with
her. The bed will be much more comfortable for
her poor arm than a berth would be, and Mrs. Kennedy
can look after her better, too, in that way.
The little parlor of the suite will give us all a cozy
place to meet together. There are two berths there
which they turn into a lounge in the daytime. I
thought perhaps you and Miss Cordelia could sleep
there. Then I have staterooms for the rest of us&mdash;I
engaged them all a week ago, of course. Now
if you'll come with me I reckon we can set up
housekeeping right away," he finished with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Setting up housekeeping" proved to be an absorbing
task, indeed. It included not only bestowing
their belongings in the chosen places, but interviewing
purser and stewards in regard to rugs,
steamer chairs, and other delightfully exciting matters.
Then there was the joy of exploring the great
ship that was to be their home for so many days.
The luxurious Ladies' Parlor, the Library with its
alluring books and magazines, the Dining Saloon
with its prettily-laid tables and its revolving chairs
(like piano stools, Tilly said), the decks with their
long, airy promenades, all came in for delighted exclamations
of satisfaction which increased to a
chorus of oh's and ah's when the trip really began,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and the stately ship was wending its way down the
Great River to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>First there was to be seen the city itself, nestled
beyond its barricade of levees.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" shuddered Cordelia. "I don't believe
I'd have slept a wink last night if I'd realized
how <i>much</i> below the river we were. Only fancy if
one of those levees had sprung a leak!"</p>

<p>"Why, they'd have sent for the plumber, of
course," observed Tilly, gravely.</p>

<p>"Of course! Still&mdash;they don't look very leaky,
to me," laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Was it here, or somewhere else, that a man (or
was it a child?) put his arm (or was it a finger?)
in a little hole in the wall and stopped the leak, and
so saved the town?" mused Bertha aloud dreamily.</p>

<p>"Of course it was," answered Tilly with grave
emphasis; and not until the others laughed did
Bertha wake up enough to turn her back with a
shrug.</p>

<p>"Well, it was somewhere, anyhow," she pouted.</p>

<p>"As if we could doubt that&mdash;after what you
said," murmured Tilly.</p>

<p>"But they have had floods here, haven't they?"
questioned Alma Lane.</p>

<p>Genevieve gave a sudden laugh. At the others'
surprised look she explained:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not laughing at the real floods, the
<i>water</i> floods they've had, of course. It's just that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
happened to think of something I read some time
ago. They had one flood here of&mdash;molasses."</p>

<p>"Mo&mdash;lass&mdash;es!" chorused several voices.</p>

<p>"Yes. A big tank that the city used to have for
a reservoir had been bought by a sugar company and
turned into a storage for molasses. Well, it burst
one day, and a little matter of a million gallons of
molasses went exploring through the streets. They
say some poor mortals had actually to wade to dry
land."</p>

<p>"Genevieve! what a story," cried Elsie.</p>

<p>"But it's true," declared Genevieve. "A whole
half-mile square of the city was flooded, honestly.
At least, the newspapers said it was."</p>

<p>"How the pickaninnies must have gloried in it,"
giggled Tilly, "&mdash;if they liked 'bread and perlashes'
as well as I used to. Only think of having
such a <i>big</i> saucerful to dip your bread into!"</p>

<p>"Tilly!" groaned Genevieve.</p>

<p>They were at Port Chalmette, now. The Crescent
City lay behind them, and beyond lay the
shining river-roadway, with its fertile, highly-cultivated
plantations bordering each side, green and
beautiful.</p>

<p>"How perfectly, perfectly lovely!" cried Elsie.
"And I'm not sick one bit."</p>

<p>"Naturally not&mdash;yet," laughed Tilly. "But you
just wait. We don't sail the Mississippi all the way
to New York, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish we did," said Genevieve, her eyes dreamily
following the shore line. "But we're only on it
for a hundred miles."</p>

<p>"I don't," disagreed Elsie. "I want to see the
Gulf Stream. They say it's a deep indigo blue,
and that you can see it plainly. I think a blue
river in a green sea must be lovely&mdash;like a
blue ribbon trailing down a light green gown, you
know."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to see the real ocean, 'way out&mdash;out.
I want to see nothing but water, water everywhere,"
declared Alma Lane.</p>

<p>"'And not a drop to drink,'" quoted Tilly.
"Well, young lady, you may see the time when
you'd give your eyes for a bit of land&mdash;and just
any old land would do, too, so long as it <i>stayed
put!</i>"</p>

<p>"What does it feel like to be seasick?" asked
Cordelia, interestedly.</p>

<p>"It feels as if the bottom had dropped out of
everything, and you didn't much care, only you
wished you'd gone with it," laughed Tilly.</p>

<p>"Who was it?&mdash;wasn't it Mark Twain who said
that the first half-hour you were awfully afraid you
would die, and the next you were awfully afraid
you wouldn't?" questioned Elsie.</p>

<p>"I don't know; but whoever said it knew what
he was talking about," declared Tilly. "You just
wait!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're waiting," murmured Genevieve, demurely.</p>

<p>"You young ladies don't want to forget your
exercise," said Mr. Hartley smilingly, coming up at
that moment with Mrs. Kennedy. "We've just
been five times around the deck."</p>

<p>"It's eleven laps to the mile," supplemented Mrs.
Kennedy with a smile.</p>

<p>"What's a lap?" asked Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Sounds like a kitten on a wager with a saucer
of milk," laughed Tilly, frowning a little as she tried
to adjust her sling more comfortably.</p>

<p>"Well, young ladies, we'll show you just what
a lap is, if you'll come with us," promised Mr. Hartley;
and with alacrity the girls expressed themselves
as being quite ready to be shown.</p>

<p>On and on, mile after mile, down the great river
swept the great ship until Forts Jackson and St.
Philip were reached and left behind; then on and
on for other miles to the narrow South Pass where
on either side the Eads Jetties called forth exclamations
of wonder.</p>

<p>"Well, you'd better 'ah' and 'um,'" laughed
Genevieve. "They happen to be one of the greatest
engineering feats in the world; that's all."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" demanded Bertha.</p>

<p>"Don't worry her," cut in Tilly, with mock sympathy.
"Poor thing! it's only a case of another
guidebook, of course."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, all is, just keep your weather eye open,"
laughed Genevieve, "for when we make the South
Pass Lightship, then ho! for the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Broad Atlantic," interposed Tilly.</p>

<p>"Well, not until you've passed through the little
matter of the Gulf of Mexico," rejoined Genevieve;
while a chorus of laughing voices jeered:</p>

<p>"Why, Tilly Mack, where's your geography?"</p>

<p>"Don't know, I'm sure," returned Tilly, imperturbably.
"Haven't seen it since I studied up
Texas," she finished as she turned away.</p>

<p>The first night aboard ship was another experience
never to be forgotten by the Happy Hexagons.
In the parlor of the suite Genevieve and Cordelia
kept up such an incessant buzz of husky whispering
and tittering that Mrs. Kennedy came out from the
bedroom to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"My dears, you mean to be quiet, I know; but
I'm sure you don't realize how it sounds from our
room. Tilly is nervous and feverish to-night&mdash;the
day has been very exciting for her."</p>

<p>"And she has tried so hard to keep up, and seem
as usual, too," cried Genevieve, contritely. "Of
course we'll keep still! Cordelia, I'm ashamed of
you," she finished severely. Then, at Cordelia's
amazed look of shocked distress, she hugged her
spasmodically. "As if it wasn't all my fault," she
chuckled.</p>

<p>In other parts of the boat the rest of the party<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
explored their strange quarters to the last corner;
then made themselves ready to be "laid on the
shelf," as Elsie termed going to bed in the narrow
berth.</p>

<p>"I shall take off my shoes to-night," announced
Bertha with dignity, after a long moment of silence.
"If anything happens here we'll get into the water,
of course, and I think shoes would only be a nuisance."</p>

<p>For a moment Elsie did not answer; then, almost
hopefully she asked,</p>

<p>"I suppose if anything did happen we'd lose our
clothes&mdash;even if we ourselves were saved, wouldn't
we?"</p>

<p>"Why, I&mdash;I suppose so."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I thought," nodded Elsie, happily.
Elsie, at the moment, was engaged in taking
off a somewhat unevenly faded green chambray
frock.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was on the second day of the trip that Cordelia
took from her suit-case a sheet of paper, worn with
much folding and refolding, and marked plainly,
"Things to do in Texas."</p>

<p>"I suppose I might as well finish this up now,"
she sighed. "I'm out of Texas, and what is done
is done; and what is undone can't ever be done,
now." And carefully she spread the paper out and
reached into her bag for her pencil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>When she had finished her work, the paper read
as follows:</p>

<p>See the blue bonnet&mdash;the Texas state flower.
Find out if it really is shaped like a bonnet. Didn't.</p>

<p>Bring home a piece of prairie grass. Did.</p>

<p>See a real buffalo. Did. (But it was in a park.)</p>

<p>Find Hermit Joe Sanborn's son, John, who ran
away to Texas twenty years ago. Didn't.</p>

<p>See an Osage orange hedge. Did.</p>

<p>See a broncho bursted (obviously changed over
from "busted"). Did.</p>

<p>Find out for Mrs. Miller if cowboys do shoot at
sight, and yell always without just and due provocation.
Did. They do not. Cowboys are good, kind
gentlemen; but they are noisy, and some rough-looking.</p>

<p>See a mesquite tree. Did.</p>

<p>Inquire if any one has seen Mrs. Snow's daughter,
Lizzie, who ran away with a Texas man named
Higgins. Did. (But could not find any one who
had.)</p>

<p>Pick a fig. Didn't.</p>

<p>See a rice canal. Did.</p>

<p>Find out what has become of Mrs. Granger's
cousin, Lester Goodwin, who went to Texas fourteen
years ago. Did.</p>

<p>See cotton growing, and pick a cotton boll, called
"Texas Roses." Did.</p>

<p>See peanuts growing. Did.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Inquire for James Hunt, brother of Miss Sally
Hunt. Did. (But could not find him.)</p>

<p>See a real Indian. Did.</p>

<p>Look at oil well for Mr. Hodges, and see if there
is any there. Did. (But there wasn't any there like
the one he wanted.)</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The paper completed, Cordelia looked at it with
troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound quite right," she thought.
"Somehow, the things <i>I</i> wanted to do are 'most all
done, but I didn't find but just one of those people,
and seems as if I ought to have done better than
that. Besides, I'm not at all sure Mrs. Granger will
be satisfied with what I did find for her&mdash;a cowboy,
so!" And she sighed as she put the paper
away.</p>

<p>The trip across the Gulf of Mexico to Dry Tortugas
Light was nothing but a rest and a joy to everybody.
It was still delightful and wonderfully interesting
all the way around the City of Key West and
up by the southeastern coast of Florida with its
many lights and coral reefs.</p>

<p>Here Genevieve's guidebook came again into
prominence.</p>

<p>"The Sand Key Light 'way back there is our
most southern possession, and only fifty-seven miles
from the line of the Tropics," she announced glibly
one day. "We're coming to the American Shoals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Light, the Sombrero Light, Alligator Light, Carysfort
Light and Fowey Rock Light."</p>

<p>"Mercy! Didn't you sleep <i>any</i> last night?" inquired
Tilly, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean you think it must have
taken all night to learn all that," laughed Genevieve.
"But it didn't."</p>

<p>"Maybe you know some more, now," hazarded
Tilly.</p>

<p>"Certainly. After we strike Jupiter Light, we
veer off into the Atlantic out of sight of land."</p>

<p>"I thought lighthouses were put up so you
wouldn't 'strike' them," observed Tilly, with
smooth politeness; "but then, of course if you do
strike them, it is quite to be expected that you veer
off into the Atlantic, and never see land again. Besides,
I found all those lighthouses and things on a
paper last night, but it was the southern trip that
did all that. Maybe we, going north, don't do the
same things at all. I sha'n't swallow all you say,
anyhow, till I know for sure."</p>

<p>"Children, stop your quarreling," commanded
Bertha Brown, sternly. "Now I've been learning
something worth while. <i>I</i> know the saloon deck
from the promenade deck, and I can rattle off
'fore' and 'aft' and 'port' and 'starboard' as
if I'd been born on shipboard!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! You wait," teased Tilly. "There'll
come a time when you won't think you're born on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
shipboard, and you won't know or care which is
fore or aft&mdash;any of you. And it will come soon,
too. Those were porpoises playing this morning&mdash;when
Cordelia thought she saw the sea serpent,
you know. I heard a man say he thought it meant
a storm was coming. And if it does&mdash;you just
wait," she finished laughingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm waiting," retorted Bertha. "I like
waiting. Besides, I don't think it's coming, anyhow!"</p>

<p>But it did come. Off the coast of South Carolina
they ran into a heavy storm, and the great ship
creaked and groaned as it buffeted wind and
wave.</p>

<p>In the little parlor of the suite the entire party,
banished from wet, slippery decks, made merry together,
and declared it was all fun, anyway. But
gradually the ranks thinned. First Mrs. Kennedy
asked to be excused, and went into the bedroom.
Alma Lane went away next. She said she wanted
a drink of water&mdash;but she did not return, and very
soon Elsie Martin, looking suspiciously white about
the lips, said she guessed she would go and find
Alma. She, too, did not return.</p>

<p>Tilly went next. Tilly, naturally, had not been
her usual self since the accident, in spite of her
brave attempts to hide her suffering. She slipped
away now without a word; though just before she
had made them all laugh by saying a little shakily:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare, I wish Reddy were here! He'd think
he was riding his broncho, sure."</p>

<p>Just when Mr. Hartley disappeared, no one
seemed to know. One moment he had been singing
lustily "Pull for the Shore"; the next moment he
was gone. There was left then only Bertha with
Genevieve and Cordelia in the little parlor; and
certainly the last two were anything but sorry when
Bertha rose a little precipitately to go, too, saying:</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think, Genevieve, if you don't mind, I'll
go and take off my shoes. They sort of&mdash;hurt
me."</p>

<p>"Honestly, Cordelia," moaned Genevieve, when
they had the room to themselves, "I reckon we're
not caring just now, whether we're fore or aft!"</p>

<p>It was not really a serious storm, after all, and
not any of the party was seriously ill. They were all
on deck again, indeed, smiling and happy, even if a
little white-faced, long before the journey was
ended.</p>

<p>It was during the very last of the "golden
hours" that Tilly, her eyes on Bartholdi's wonderful
Statue of Liberty just ahead of them, in the
New York Bay, choked:</p>

<p>"I declare, I'd just like to give that lady our
Texas yell. Only think, girls, our Texas trip is
almost over!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>HERMIT JOE</h3>


<p>There was not quite so large a crowd at the
Sunbridge station to welcome the Texas travelers
as there had been to see them off; but it was fully
large enough to give a merry cheer of greeting, as
the train pulled into the little station.</p>

<p>"They're all here, with their 'sisters and their
cousins and their aunts,'" laughed Tilly, stooping
to look through the window as she passed down the
narrow aisle behind Genevieve.</p>

<p>"I should say they were," answered Genevieve
a little wistfully. "We haven't got any one, I'm
afraid, though. Miss Jane's been 'down in Maine,'
as you call it, visiting, and she doesn't come till next
week."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you have," chuckled Tilly, as she
caught sight of an eager face in the crowd.
"There's Harold Day."</p>

<p>"Pooh! He didn't come to welcome me any more
than he did the rest of you," retorted Genevieve
severely, as she neared the door.</p>

<p>And what a confusion and chatter it all was, when
"their sisters and their cousins and their aunts"&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
say nothing of their fathers and mothers and
brothers&mdash;all talked and laughed at once, each trying
to be first to kiss and hug the <i>one</i> returning
traveler, before bestowing almost as cordial a welcome
on all the others. At last, however, in little
family groups, afoot or in carriages, the crowd
began to leave the station, and Genevieve found
herself with Mrs. Kennedy in the family carriage
with the old coachman sitting sedately up in front.
Mr. Hartley had left the party in New York, after
seeing them safely aboard their Boston train.</p>

<p>"Well, it's all over," sighed Genevieve, happily,
"and hasn't it been just lovely&mdash;with nothing but
poor Tilly's arm to regret!"</p>

<p>"Yes, it certainly has been a beautiful trip, my
dear, and I know every one has enjoyed it very
much. And now comes&mdash;school."</p>

<p>Genevieve made a wry face; then, meeting Mrs.
Kennedy's reproving eye, she colored.</p>

<p>"There, forgive me, Aunt Julia, please. That
wasn't nice of me, of course, when you're so good
as to let me come another year. But school is so
tiresome!"</p>

<p>"Tiresome! Oh, my dear!"</p>

<p>"Well, it is, Aunt Julia," sighed the girl.</p>

<p>"But I thought you liked it now, dear. You took
hold of it so bravely at the last." Mrs. Kennedy's
eyes were wistful.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course I wanted to pass and go on with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
the rest of the girls, Aunt Julia. I couldn't help
wanting that. But as for really <i>liking</i> it&mdash;I
couldn't like it, you know; just study, study, study
all day in hot, poky rooms, when it's so much nicer
out of doors!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy shook her head. Her eyes were
troubled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid, my dear, that this trip <i>hasn't</i> helped
any. I was fearful that it wouldn't be easy for you
to settle down after such a prolonged playday."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I shall settle, Aunt Julia, I shall settle,"
promised Genevieve with a merry smile. "I know
I've got to settle&mdash;but I can't say yet I shall like
it," she finished, as the carriage turned in at the
broad driveway, and Nancy and Bridget were seen
to be waiting in respectful excitement to welcome
them.</p>

<p>There would be five days to "get used to it"&mdash;as
Genevieve expressed it&mdash;before school began;
but long before noon of the first of those five days,
Genevieve had planned in her mind enough delightful
things to occupy twice that number of days. Immediately
after dinner, too, came something quite
unexpected in the shape of a call from Cordelia.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked worried.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, I've come to ask a favor, please.
I'm sure I don't know as you'll want to do it, but&mdash;but
I want you to go with me to see Hermit Joe."</p>

<p>"To see&mdash;<i>Hermit Joe!</i>"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"O dear, I knew you'd exclaim out," sighed Cordelia;
"but it's just got to be done. I suppose I
ought not to have told you, anyway, but I couldn't
bear to go up to that dismal place alone," she finished,
tearfully.</p>

<p>"Why, of course not, dear; and I'm sure you
did just right to tell me," soothed Genevieve, in
quick response to the tears in Cordelia's eyes.
"Now wait while I get my hat and ask Aunt Julia.
She'll let me go, I know;&mdash;she'd let me go to&mdash;to
London, with <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Just please say it's an errand&mdash;an important
one," begged Cordelia, nervously, as Genevieve
darted into the house.</p>

<p>In two minutes the girl had returned, hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Now tell me all about it," she commanded,
"and don't look so frightened. Hermit Joe isn't
cross. He's only solemn and queer. He won't hurt
us."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he won't hurt us," sighed the other.
"He'll only look more solemn and queer."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because of what I've got to tell him. I&mdash;I
suppose I ought to have written it, but I just
couldn't. Besides, I hadn't found out anything, and
so I didn't want to write until I was sure I couldn't
find anything. Now it's done, and I haven't found
out anything. So I've got to tell him."</p>

<p>"Tell him what, Cordelia?" demanded Genevieve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
a little impatiently. "How do you suppose
I can make anything out of that kind of talk?"</p>

<p>"O dear! you can't, of course," sighed Cordelia;
"and, of course, if I've told you so much I
must tell the rest. It's Hermit Joe's son. I can't
find him."</p>

<p>"His son! I didn't know he had a son."</p>

<p>"He has. His name is John. He ran away to
Texas twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"And you've been hunting for <i>him</i>, too&mdash;besides
that Lester Goodwin who turned out to be Reddy?"</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded. She did not speak.</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed unexpectedly.</p>

<p>"Of all the funny things I ever heard of! Pray,
how many more lost people have you been looking
for in the little state of Texas?"</p>

<p>Cordelia moved her shoulders uneasily.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd rather not tell that, please, Genevieve,"
she stammered, with a painful blush.</p>

<p>Genevieve stared dumbly. She had not supposed
for a moment that Cordelia had been looking for
any more lost people. She had asked the question
merely as an absurdity. To have it taken now in
this literal fashion, and evidently with good reason&mdash;Genevieve
could scarcely believe the evidence of
her senses. Another laugh was almost on her lips,
but the real distress in Cordelia's face stopped it in
time.</p>

<p>"You poor dear little thing," she cried sympathetically.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
"What a shame to bother you so! I
wonder you had any fun at all on the trip."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I did, Genevieve! You don't know how
beautiful it all was to me&mdash;only of course I felt
sorry to be such a failure in what folks wanted me
to do. You see, Reddy was the only one I found,
and I'm very much worried for fear he won't be
satisfactory."</p>

<p>Genevieve did laugh this time.</p>

<p>"Well, if he isn't, I don't see how that can be
your fault," she retorted. "Come, now let's forget
all this, and just talk Texas instead."</p>

<p>"Aunt Mary says I do do that&mdash;all the time,"
rejoined Cordelia, with a wistful smile. "Aunt
Sophronia is there, too, and <i>she</i> says I do. Still,
she likes to hear it, I verily believe, else she wouldn't
ask me so many questions," concluded Cordelia, lifting
her chin a little.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take Miss Jane there sometime,"
observed Genevieve, with a gravity that was a little
unnatural.</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy!" exclaimed Cordelia&mdash;then she
stopped short with a hot blush. "I&mdash;I beg your
pardon, I'm sure, Genevieve," she went on stammeringly.
"I ought not to have spoken that way,
of course. I was only thinking of Miss Jane and&mdash;and
the cowboys that day they welcomed us."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," rejoined Genevieve, her lips
puckered into a curious little smile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe I'm doing any more talking,
anyway, than Tilly is," remarked Cordelia, after a
moment's silence. "Of course, Tilly, with her poor
arm, would make a lot of questions, anyway; but
she <i>is</i> talking a great deal."</p>

<p>"I suppose she is," chuckled Genevieve, "and we
all know what <i>she'll</i> say."</p>

<p>"But she says such absurd things, Genevieve.
Why, Charlie Brown&mdash;you know he calls us the
'Happy <i>Tex</i>agons' now&mdash;well, he told me that
Tilly'd been bragging so terribly about Texas,
and all the fine things there were there, that he asked
her this morning real soberly&mdash;you know how
Charlie Brown <i>can</i> ask questions, sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," nodded Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Well, he asked her, solemn as a judge, 'Do
these wondrous tamales of yours grow on trees
down there?'</p>

<p>"'Oh, yes,' Tilly assured him serenely. And
when Charlie, of course, declared that couldn't be,
she just shrugged her shoulders and answered:
'Well, of course, Charlie, I'll own I didn't <i>see</i>
tamales growing on trees, but Texas is a very large
state, and while I didn't, of course, see anywhere
near all of it, yet I saw so much, and it was all so
different from each other, that I'm sure I shouldn't
want to say that I <i>knew</i> they didn't have tamale
trees somewhere in Texas!' And then she
marched off in that stately way of hers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Charlie declared he began to feel as if tamale trees
did grow in Texas, and that he ought to go around
telling folks so."</p>

<p>"What a girl she is!" laughed Genevieve.
"But, Cordelia, she isn't all nonsense. We found
that out that dreadful night of the accident."</p>

<p>"Indeed we did," agreed Cordelia, loyally;
then, with a profound sigh she added: "O dear!
for a minute I'd actually forgotten&mdash;Hermit Joe."</p>

<p>Hermit Joe lived far up the hillside in a little hut
surrounded by thick woods. A tiny path led to his
door, but it was seldom trodden by the foot of anybody
but of Hermit Joe himself&mdash;Hermit Joe did
not encourage visitors, and visitors certainly were
not attracted by Hermit Joe's stern reticence on all
matters concerning himself and every one else.</p>

<p>To-day, as the girls entered the path at the edge
of the woods, the sun went behind a passing cloud,
and the gloom was even more noticeable than usual.</p>

<p>"Mercy! I'm glad Hermit Joe <i>isn't</i> dangerous
and <i>doesn't</i> bite," whispered Genevieve, peering into
the woods on either side. "Aunt Julia says he is
really a very estimable man&mdash;Cordelia, if I was a
man I just wouldn't be an 'estimable' one."</p>

<p>"Genevieve!" gasped the shocked Cordelia.</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd <i>be</i> it, of course, my dear, only I wouldn't
want to be <i>called</i> it. It's the word&mdash;it always
makes me think of side whiskers and stupidity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve!" cried Cordelia, again.</p>

<p>"Well, as I was saying, Aunt Julia told me that
Hermit Joe was really a very nice man. She used
to know him well before a great sorrow drove him
into the woods to live all by himself."</p>

<p>Cordelia nodded sadly.</p>

<p>"That was his son that ran away. Aunt Mary
told me that long ago. She told us children never
to tease him, or worry him, but that we needn't be
afraid of him, either. He wouldn't hurt us. I
heard once that he was always stern and sober, and
that that was why his son ran away. But that it
'most killed him&mdash;the father&mdash;when he did go.
And now I couldn't find him! Isn't it terrible,
Genevieve?" Cordelia's eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Genevieve. "But you aren't to
blame, dear."</p>

<p>It was very beautiful in the hushed green light
of the woods, with now and then a bird-call, or the
swift scampering of a squirrel's feet to break the
silence. But the girls were not noticing birds or
squirrels to-day, and they became more and more
silent as they neared the end of their journey.
The little cabin was almost in sight when Genevieve
caught Cordelia's arm convulsively.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, sh-h-h! Isn't that some one&mdash;talking?"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Cordelia held her right foot suspended in the air
for a brief half minute.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. That's Hermit Joe's voice. He <i>is</i> talking
to some one."</p>

<p>"Then there must be somebody there with him."</p>

<p>"Yes. Genevieve, I&mdash;I <i>guess</i> I won't tell him
to-day," faltered Cordelia. "Let's go back. I'll
come again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Go back, and have you worrying
about this thing another twenty-four hours? No,
indeed! Come, Cordelia, we must tell him now.
I think we ought to do it, really."</p>

<p>"All right," sighed the other despairingly.
"Come, then." The next minute she gave a sharp
cry. "Why, Mr. <i>Edwards!</i>" she breathed.</p>

<p>They had come to the turn which brought the
cabin into plain sight; and on the stone step with
Hermit Joe sat the man Cordelia had last seen
driving away from the Six Star Ranch in Texas.</p>

<p>Both men rose abruptly. The younger stepped
forward. There was a whimsical smile on his lips,
but his eyes were wonderfully tender.</p>

<p>"Yes, 'Mr. Edwards,' Miss Cordelia&mdash;but Mr.
'Jonathan Edwards <i>Sanborn</i>.' You see, you didn't
know all my name, perhaps."</p>

<p>To every one's surprise and consternation Cordelia
sat down exactly where she was, and began
to cry softly.</p>

<p>"Why, Cordelia!"</p>

<p>Genevieve was at her friend's side at once. Hermit
Joe looked plainly distressed. Mr. Jonathan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Edwards Sanborn hurried forward in frightened
dismay.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Miss Cordelia, don't, please don't&mdash;I
beg of you! Don't you understand? I am John
Sanborn, Hermit Joe's son; and 'twas all through
you that I came home again."</p>

<p>Cordelia only sobbed the harder.</p>

<p>Genevieve dropped on her knees at the girl's side,
and put her arms about her.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, Cordelia, dear&mdash;don't you see?&mdash;it's
all come out right. You did find him, after
all! Why are you crying so?"</p>

<p>"T-that's why," stuttered Cordelia, smiling
through tear-wet eyes. "It's because I d-did find
him, and I'm so glad, and everything!"</p>

<p>"But, if you're glad, why cry?" began Hermit
Joe's son, in puzzled wonder, but Genevieve patted
Cordelia's back, and smiled cheerily.</p>

<p>"That's all right, Cordelia," she declared. "I
know just how you feel. <i>Now</i> you know what was
the matter with me when you girls gave me the
Texas yell at the station. Just cry all you like!"</p>

<p>As if permission, only, were all she wanted, Cordelia
wiped her eyes and smiled shyly into Mr.
Jonathan Edwards Sanborn's face.</p>

<p>"It is really you, isn't it?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"It certainly is, Miss Cordelia."</p>

<p>"And you wouldn't have come if it hadn't been
for what I said?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. You set me to thinking, and when I got
to thinking I couldn't stop. And, of course, when
I couldn't stop thinking I had to come; that's all."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," sighed Cordelia; then, interestedly:
"How long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Only since day before yesterday. No one in
the village knows I'm here, I suspect. We've been
talking over our plans&mdash;father and I. I want him
to come West with me."</p>

<p>Cordelia got up from the ground.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad," she said again, simply. "Genevieve,
I think we ought to be going."</p>

<p>As she turned toward the path, Hermit Joe advanced
so that he intercepted her.</p>

<p>"Miss Cordelia, I would like to tell how&mdash;but
I can't. Still&mdash;I wish you could know how happy
you've made me."</p>

<p>Hermit Joe spoke with evident difficulty. His
lips, so long unused to speaking, stumbled over the
words; but his eyes glowed as with hidden fires,
and his whole face was alight with joy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>THE NEW BOY</h3>


<p>The first day of school, for Genevieve, was not
a success. Before two hours of it had passed, indeed,
she declared to herself that Miss Hart, her
new teacher, was not at all promising, and that
she did not like her nearly so well as she had liked
Miss Palmer the year before. Making the final
arrangements as to her studies and recitations, too,
Genevieve privately voted a bore; and more than
once her eyes turned longingly to the beautiful September
sunshine out of doors.</p>

<p>At recess time the Happy Hexagons met in the
corridor and held what proved to be an indignation
meeting.</p>

<p>"Well, I for one don't like her a bit," declared
Tilly, perking up the bow ends of the black sling
that hung about her neck.</p>

<p>"Nor I," echoed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Not much like Miss Palmer last year, nor Miss
Jones," said Bertha. "I told you we wouldn't get
such a good one this term."</p>

<p>"But, girls, I think we ought to try to like her,"
ventured Cordelia, in a voice that told very plainly
how she expected her remark to be received.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," sniffed Tilly, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm sure she won't be half bad when
we come to know her," cried Alma Lane. "She
was so nervous this morning, and I think acted
troubled over something."</p>

<p>Tilly tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Troubled! I should think we were the ones
that were troubled. Did you ever see such a lot of
rules and regulations about what not to do? She's
scarcely left a thing we <i>can</i> do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she has," groaned Genevieve. "We
can sit still and look pleasant, and study, study,
study! I reckon I shall have to, all right, too, this
term, at the rate my studies and recitation hours
are piling up," she finished, as the bell rang for
them to go to their seats.</p>

<p>All days&mdash;even the worst of them&mdash;come to
an end sometime; and at last Genevieve was free
to go home. Half-way to the Kennedy house a
soft whistle of the Happy Hexagons' Club song
sounded behind her; and a moment later Harold
Day caught up with her.</p>

<p>"Well?" he queried.</p>

<p>"But it isn't 'well' at all," wailed Genevieve,
with a shake of her head.</p>

<p>"So I judged from your face."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;have <i>you</i> ever had Miss Hart for a
teacher?"</p>

<p>"No; she's new this year. We had Miss Holbrook<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
in her place last year, and she was fine; but
she got married, you know. She herself recommended
Miss Hart for the position, I believe."</p>

<p>"Did she?" sighed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"What a lugubrious face!" laughed Harold.
"Suppose you tell me what is the matter with Miss
Hart, eh?"</p>

<p>"I can't. It's just an intangible, indefinable
'don't-like-her' feeling. She doesn't sit still a
minute, and she's awful on rules. Tilly calls her
'Miss Hartless.'"</p>

<p>Harold laughed.</p>

<p>"Trust Tilly to call her something!" he rejoined.
"But I don't believe the lady will be half
bad when you get used to her."</p>

<p>"That's what your cousin Alma says."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe she's right," declared Harold.
"It sounds to me as if Miss Hart were nervous
and afraid."</p>

<p>Genevieve opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"Afraid! A <i>teacher afraid!</i>"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you be afraid if you had to follow
where you know there had been such favorites as
Miss Holbrook and Miss Palmer were?"</p>

<p>"Why, I never thought of it that way," frowned
Genevieve. "I didn't suppose teachers ever had&mdash;er&mdash;feelings
like that."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose teachers are&mdash;folks, like the
rest of us," hazarded the youth, as he stopped a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
minute at the foot of the Kennedys' front
walk.</p>

<p>Genevieve shook her head mischievously.</p>

<p>"I don't," she protested. "They always seem
to me like things you buy for school, just like you
do the books and chalk, and that they come in boxes
all graded and sorted&mdash;primary, grammar, high
school, French, German, and all that," she flashed
over her shoulder, as she skipped up the walk
toward the house.</p>

<p>"There!" sighed Genevieve, bounding up on to
the veranda, and dropping her books into a chair.
"I'm going for a ride with Tilly, Aunt Julia, please,
if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear; but don't stay too long.
There's your practicing, you know."</p>

<p>Genevieve scowled, and made an impatient gesture&mdash;neither
of which Mrs. Kennedy seemed to
notice.</p>

<p>"You have your watch, I see," she went on
serenely; "so I don't think you'll forget."</p>

<p>Genevieve bit her lip. She threw a hurried
glance into Mrs. Kennedy's face; but that, too,
Mrs. Kennedy did not appear to notice.</p>

<p>"No, Aunt Julia," said Genevieve, a little constrainedly,
as she went to saddle her horse, "I
sha'n't&mdash;forget."</p>

<p>When quite by herself around the corner of the
house, she drew a long breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sometimes," she muttered fiercely behind her
teeth, "sometimes I&mdash;I just wish folks <i>weren't</i>
so good to me! Seems to me I just <i>can't</i> waste
a whole hour of this tiny little bit of glorious day
that is left, practising a stupid old 'one, two&mdash;one,
two&mdash;one, two!'" Then, with apparent irrelevance,
she patted her blue-and-gold chatelaine
watch remorsefully&mdash;and it may be noted right
here that she came back in ample time for her hour
of practising before supper.</p>

<p>There was a new boy at school the next morning.
This fact in itself did not particularly interest the
Happy Hexagons until they learned his name. It
was "O. B. J. Holmes." When the initials did not
seem quite to satisfy Miss Hart, he hesitated visibly,
then said, with a very painful blush, that the "O"
might be put down "Oliver." It was plainly on
the teacher's tongue to ask about the other letters;
but, after a moment's hesitation, she passed over
the matter, and turned to something else.</p>

<p>As usual the Happy Hexagons found themselves
together at recess time, and as was natural, perhaps,
the subject of the new boy came up for discussion.</p>

<p>"I don't believe 'Oliver' is ever his name," declared
Tilly, stoutly. "No sane youth in his right
mind would blush so beautifully over just 'Oliver.'
Besides, he didn't <i>say</i> it was Oliver."</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;&#39;HOW DO YOU DO, MR. OLIVER HOLMES,&#39; SHE BEGAN&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I saw Miss Hart talking to him as I came out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
just now," announced Bertha, "and his face was
even redder than ever. Hers was getting red, too."</p>

<p>"Then there <i>is</i> something," cried Genevieve, excitedly,
"and it's a mystery. I love mysteries!
'O. B. J.'&mdash;what a really funny set of letters!"</p>

<p>"Must be 'Oliver Ben Johnson,'" laughed
Bertha.</p>

<p>"Sounds to me like 'O Be Joyful,'" giggled
Tilly.</p>

<p>"Sh-h!&mdash;Tilly!" warned Cordelia, in a horrified
whisper. "He's coming. He'll hear you!"</p>

<p>But Tilly was not to be silenced. Tilly, for some
reason, felt recklessly mischievous that morning.</p>

<p>"Why, of course his, name is 'O Be Joyful,'"
she cried in gay, shrill tones that carried the words
straight to the ears of a rather awkward-appearing
boy coming toward them. "How could it be anything else?"</p>

<p>The boy blushed hotly. For a moment it seemed
as if he would stop and speak; but the next minute
he had turned away his face, and was passing them
hurriedly.</p>

<p>It was then that the unexpected happened. With
a quick little impulsive movement, Genevieve stepped
to the new boy's side, and held out a frankly cordial
hand.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Mr. Oliver Holmes," she began
breathlessly, but with hurried determination.
"I am Genevieve Hartley, and I'd like to welcome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
you to our school. These are my friends: Cordelia
Wilson, Alma Lane, Bertha Brown, Elsie Martin,
and Tilly Mack. We hope you'll soon get acquainted
and feel at home here," she finished, her
face almost as painful a red as was the boy's.</p>

<p>O. B. J. Holmes clutched Genevieve's hand,
stammered a confused something in response to the
introductions, and flung a terrifiedly uncertain bow
in the direction of the wide-eyed girls; then he
turned and fled precipitately.</p>

<p>Behind him he left, for one brief minute, a dazed
silence before Tilly lifted her chin disagreeably and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, dear me! For so <i>marked</i> a bid for his
favor, seems to me our young friend doesn't show
proper appreciation&mdash;to run away like that!"</p>

<p>Genevieve colored angrily.</p>

<p>"That was no bid for his favor, and you know
it, Tilly Mack!"</p>

<p>"No?" teased Tilly, hatefully. "Well, I'm sure
I should have thought it was if a perfect stranger
flung herself in my way like that."</p>

<p>"Tilly, Tilly&mdash;don't!" begged Cordelia, almost
tearfully.</p>

<p>It was Genevieve's turn to lift a disdainful chin.
She eyed Tilly scornfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't&mdash;not if some other perfect
stranger had just called out a particularly hateful,
horrid joke about something you were not in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
the least to blame for! If you hadn't said what you
did, I shouldn't have said what I did, Tilly Mack.
As it was, I&mdash;I just couldn't help it; I was so
sorry for him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, it was just being sorry, then! Oh, excuse
me; I didn't know," cooed Tilly, smoothly. "You
see, it looked so&mdash;different!"</p>

<p>"Tilly!" gasped Cordelia. "Genevieve, don't
you mind one bit what she says!" But Genevieve,
without a word, had turned and was walking swiftly
away.</p>

<p>"Well, Tilly Mack," chorused several indignant
voices; and Elsie Martin added severely: "I've
got my opinion of <i>you</i>&mdash;after all Genevieve has
just done for us! I'm sure, I think it was lovely of
her to speak to that boy like that!"</p>

<p>Tilly flushed uncomfortably. Her tongue had
gone much farther than she had intended it to go.
She did not like to think, either, of that Texas trip
just then. But the very shame that she felt made
her only the more determined not to show it&mdash;then.</p>

<p>"Pooh! there wasn't a thing I said that anybody
need to make such a fuss about," she declared
loftily; then, as she spied Harold Day coming
toward them, she called in a merry voice: "Seen
the new boy, Harold? His name is 'O. B. J.
Holmes.' <i>I</i> say his name is 'O Be Joyful,' and the
girls are shocked at my disrespect."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that so?" laughed Harold. "Well, I'm not
sure I'd like that name myself very well&mdash;even if
'tis a cheerful one! Where's Genevieve? One
doesn't often see one of you without all of you."</p>

<p>"Oh, she was here, but she's gone. She was the
most shocked of all," answered Tilly, with mock
humility. "Probably she's gone to tell him so.
You see, she shook hands with him and introduced
us all around, and said she'd like to welcome him
and that she hoped he'd enjoy it here."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tilly!" remonstrated Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Why, Cordelia, didn't she?" asked Tilly, in a
particularly innocent tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Y-yes," admitted Cordelia, reluctantly,
"only&mdash;" The bell rang and the group broke
up, with Cordelia's sentence still unfinished.</p>

<p>The rest of the day for the Happy Hexagons
was not an easy one. Tilly looked rebellious&mdash;and
ashamed. Cordelia looked ready to cry. Genevieve
kept her eyes on her books and seemed unaware
that there was such a thing in the world
as a girls' club, of which she was a prominent member.
Bertha, Elsie, and Alma divided their time
between scowling at Tilly and trying to attract
Genevieve's attention.</p>

<p>It was during the Latin recitation, which came
just before closing time at noon, that Cordelia's
perturbation culminated in a blunder that sent
most of the class into convulsive giggles, and even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
brought a twitching smile to Genevieve's tense
lips.</p>

<p>Cordelia, rising to translate in her turn, hurried
blindly through a paragraph until she came to the
words "sub jugum". Now Cordelia very well
knew what "sub jugum" meant; but her eyes, at
the moment, were divided between her book and
Genevieve's flushed cheeks, and so saw, apparently,
but half of the word "jugum". At all events, the
next moment the class were amazed to learn from
Cordelia's lips that C&aelig;sar sent the army&mdash;not
"under the yoke" as was expected&mdash;but "under
the jug."</p>

<p>Cordelia knew, before the titters of the class told
her, what she had said; and with hot blushes she
made a hasty correction. But to Cordelia, usually
so conscientiously accurate and circumspect, the
thing was a tragedy, and, as such, would not soon
be forgotten by her. She knew, too, that the class
would not let her forget it even could she herself
do so. If she had doubted this, she did not doubt
it longer, after school was dismissed, for she was
assailed on all sides by a merry bombardment of
gibes and questions as to just what sort of jug it
was, anyhow, under which C&aelig;sar sent his army.</p>

<p>Genevieve, only, had nothing to say. She did
not, indeed, even glance toward Cordelia. With
averted face she hurried through the corridor and
out the street door alone. In the yard a quick step<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
behind her overtook her, and she found herself
looking into the flushed, agitated face of the new
boy.</p>

<p>O. B. J. Holmes would not, at first sight, be called
a good-looking youth. His face was freckled, and
his nose was rather large. But his mouth was well-shaped,
and his eyes were large and expressive.
They looked into Genevieve's now with a gaze that
was clear and honest and manly.</p>

<p>"Miss Genevieve, may I walk with you a little
way, please?" he asked with disarming directness.
"I want to speak to you."</p>

<p>"Why, of&mdash;of course," stammered Genevieve.
Then she colored painfully: behind her she heard
Tilly's laughing voice, followed by Alma's lower
one, and Harold's.</p>

<p>"I wanted to thank you for what you did this
morning," began O. B. J. Holmes, falling into step
with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't&mdash;wasn't anything," stammered
Genevieve, nervously, still acutely conscious of the
eyes that she knew were behind her.</p>

<p>The boy smiled a little wistfully.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, to you," he answered; "but if
you'd been named 'O Be Joyful' and had had to
suffer for it as I have, you'd think it was something."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say your name <i>is</i> 'O Be
Joyful'!" gasped Genevieve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>He nodded, his face showing a deeper red.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I wanted to tell you. I didn't
feel square not to have you know it, after you stood
up so bravely for 'Oliver'. Of course, if you like,
you may tell the rest. I suppose I was foolish to
try to keep it to myself, anyway," he sighed moodily.</p>

<p>"Tell it! Of course I sha'n't tell it," declared
Genevieve, warmly. She had forgotten all about
those watching eyes behind her, now.</p>

<p>"Thank you," smiled the boy again, a little wistfully.
"Miss Hart knows it, of course. I told her
at recess; and the principal, Mr. Jackson, knows it.
He agreed to letting me be called 'Oliver,' and so
does Miss Hart. Still, I don't suppose I can keep
it, and it will get out. I&mdash;I supposed it had got
out when I heard your friend this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, it isn't out, and nobody knows it&mdash;but
me," declared Genevieve, with more warmth than
grammar. "That was only some of Tilly Mack's
nonsense; and when you know her better, you'll
know that nobody pays any attention to what Tilly
says." Genevieve stopped abruptly, and bit her lip.
She was thinking that not so very long before, she
herself <i>had</i> paid attention to something Tilly Mack
said.</p>

<p>"I don't think mother ever realized just what
such a name would be for a fellow to carry through
life," said the boy, after a moment's silence.
"There were five of us children, and she gave us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
all queer names&mdash;names that expressed something
that had just been happening in the family, you understand.
For instance, my oldest brother was born
in a year when the crops failed, and they called him
'Tribulation.' Crops were good, you see, when I
came," he added, with a rueful smile.</p>

<p>"Why, how&mdash;how funny and&mdash;and terrible,"
breathed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was terrible&mdash;but mother never thought
of it that way, I'm sure. I'm glad she can't know&mdash;now&mdash;just
how hard it's been for me. When
I came here, I knew I was a perfect stranger and
I determined folks shouldn't know. I'd be 'Oliver
B. J. Holmes.'"</p>

<p>"And you shall be 'Oliver B. J. Holmes,'"
averred Genevieve, lifting her chin. "Oh, of course
Tilly will call you the other, and maybe some of the
rest will, sometimes; but don't let that fret you for
a moment. Just remember that <i>no one knows</i>&mdash;for
I sha'n't tell it. And now good-by. This is my
street," she finished, with a cheery nod.</p>

<p>It was not easy for Genevieve to go back to the
short session of school that afternoon; but she went&mdash;and
she tried to appear as if everything was as
usual when she met Cordelia and Elsie at the corner.
Cordelia and Elsie were only too glad to follow her
lead. Not until they met Tilly in the school yard&mdash;and
saw her turn hastily away without speaking&mdash;did
they show how really constrained they felt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve, apparently, saw and felt nothing of
this&mdash;but she never looked toward Tilly that afternoon;
and when school was dismissed she hurried
cheerfully away with only a smiling nod toward
Cordelia and Alma, whom she passed in the corridor.</p>

<p>At home Genevieve went immediately to her
practising&mdash;somewhat to Mrs. Kennedy's surprise.
She practised, too, quite fifteen minutes over her
hour&mdash;still more to Mrs. Kennedy's surprise.
There was, also, a certain unsympathetic hardness
in the chords and runs that puzzled the lady not a
little; but in the face of their obvious accuracy,
and of Genevieve's apparent faithfulness, Mrs.
Kennedy did not like to find fault.</p>

<p>Just how long Genevieve would have practised is
doubtful, perhaps, had there not sounded an insistently
repeated whistle of the Hexagon Club song
from the garden. The girl went to the open window
then.</p>

<p>"Did you whistle, Harold?" she asked, not too
graciously.</p>

<p>"Did I whistle?" retorted the boy, testily. "Oh,
no, I never whistled <i>once</i>&mdash;but I did four times!
See here, I thought your practice-hour was an
<i>hour</i>."</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"Well, you've been working fifteen minutes over-time
already."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have; and your constitution positively
needs a walk. Come, it's your plain duty to your
health. Will you go?"</p>

<p>Genevieve dimpled into a laugh.</p>

<p>"All right," she cried more naturally. "Then
I'll come. I'll be out in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Let's go up through the pasture to the woods,"
proposed Harold, when Genevieve appeared, swinging
her hat.</p>

<p>"All right," nodded Genevieve, somewhat listlessly.
"Anywhere."</p>

<p>In the woods, some time later, Genevieve and
Harold dropped themselves down to rest. It was
then that Harold cleared his throat a little nervously.</p>

<p>"You have a new boy in school, I hear," he
said.</p>

<p>Genevieve turned quickly. For a moment she
looked almost angry. Then, unexpectedly, she
laughed.</p>

<p>"You've been talking with Tilly, I perceive,"
she remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; Tilly has only been talking with me,"
retorted Harold, laughing in his turn&mdash;though a
little constrainedly.</p>

<p>Genevieve grew suddenly sober.</p>

<p>"I don't care; I'm glad I did it," she declared.
"You know <i>what</i> Tilly can be when she wants to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
be&mdash;and she evidently wanted to be, this morning.
Just because a boy is new and has got freckles and
a queer name, is no reason why he should be made
fun of like that."</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Then, still a little constrainedly,
Harold asked: "How do you like him? I
saw you talking with him afterward."</p>

<p>Genevieve frowned thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know&mdash;I hadn't thought," she
answered. "But I reckon perhaps I like him. He
talked quite a little, and he seemed rather nice, I
think&mdash;just frank and folksy, you know. Yes, I
think I like him. I think we'll all like him."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course," agreed Harold without enthusiasm,
getting suddenly to his feet. "Well, I suppose
we must be going."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," sighed Genevieve, glancing
down at her little blue-enamel watch; "but it <i>is</i>
nice here!"</p>

<p>The homeward walk was somewhat of a silent
one. Harold was unusually quiet, and Genevieve
was wondering just how and when peace and happiness
were to reign once more in the Hexagon Club.
She was wondering, too, if ever she could be just
the same to Tilly&mdash;unless Tilly had first something
to say to her.</p>

<p>As it happened, Genevieve's questions were answered,
in a way, before she slept; for, after she
had gone up to bed that night, there came a ring at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
the doorbell, followed, a moment later, by a tap at
her door.</p>

<p>"It do be a note for you, Miss Genevieve," explained
Nancy.</p>

<p>"A note&mdash;for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss; from Miss Tilly, I think. She's
down at the door with her brother."</p>

<p>Genevieve did not answer. Her eyes were devouring
the note.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Genevieve</span>:&mdash;" Tilly had written. "I'm
so ashamed I just can't live till you tell me you forgive
me. I have begged Howard to take me down
there. I know I never, never can sleep till I've
asked your pardon for being so perfectly horrid
this morning. Will you ever, ever forgive and love
me again?</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your miserable, remorseful</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Tilly</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>"P. S. I think what you did was just the bravest,
loveliest thing I ever saw a girl do.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">t. m.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"P. S. again. I'm so late I'm afraid you've
gone to bed; but if you haven't, and if you do forgive
me, come to your window and wave to me. I
shall watch with what Quentina would call soulful,
hungry eyes.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">t.</span>"<br />
</div></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all right; thank you, Nancy. There
isn't any answer," smiled Genevieve as she closed
the door. The next moment she darted across the
room, plucked a great pink aster from the vase on
the table, hurried to the window and threw up the
screen.</p>

<p>Below she saw the automobile and the two figures
therein. Faintly visible, too, was the upturned face
of the girl, containing, presumably, the "hungry,
soulful eyes."</p>

<p>The next moment, plump into Tilly's lap, fell a
huge pink aster.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>GENEVIEVE LEARNS SOMETHING NOT IN BOOKS</h3>


<p>School, in an amazingly short time, fell into its
customary routine. Genevieve, it is true, did not
cease to pine for long, free hours out of doors; but
with as good grace as she could muster she submitted
to the inevitable.</p>

<p>Miss Hart was still not a favorite in the school,
and no one seemed to realize this more keenly than
did Miss Hart herself. At all events, as the days
passed, she grew thinner and paler looking, and
more nervous and worried in her manner. While
none of the Happy Hexagons deliberately set herself
to making trouble, certainly none of them tried
to cause matters to be any easier for her. The
girls themselves had long since forgotten their brief
day of unpleasantness regarding O. B. J. Holmes,
and were more devoted than ever, after this, their
first quarrel.</p>

<p>In the Kennedy home, too, matters had settled
into their usual routine. Miss Jane had returned,
and the days, for Genevieve, were full of study,
practice, and the usual number of lessons in cooking
and sewing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>As the crisp October days came, every pleasant
Saturday afternoon found the Hexagon Club off
for a long walk or ride, sometimes by themselves,
sometimes with Harold, Charlie, O. B. J. Holmes,
or some of the other boys and girls as invited guests.</p>

<p>O. B. J. Holmes had long since ceased to be the
"new boy." He was not, indeed, exactly a favorite
with some of the young people, but he was included
frequently in their merrymakings&mdash;chiefly because
Genevieve declared openly that she thought he
ought to be. He was not called "Oliver" except
in the classroom. Outside he was known usually
as "O. B. J." slurred into "Obejay." Sometimes,
it is true, Tilly's old "O Be Joyful" was heard,
but not often&mdash;perhaps because the lad appeared
not to care if they did call him that, specially if
Genevieve were near to join in the good-natured
laugh with which he greeted it.</p>

<p>Undeniably, this frank friendliness of the most
popular girl in school had much to do with the way
the others regarded him; though they were at a
loss, sometimes, to account for a certain quality in
that friendship, which they could not fathom.</p>

<p>"It's for all the world as if you'd known each
other before," Harold explained it a little aggrievedly
one day to Genevieve, when O. B. J.
Holmes had just thrown her one of his merry
glances at a sudden revival of Tilly's "O Be Joyful"
name. "Say, <i>have</i> you known him before?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve laughed&mdash;but she shook her head.</p>

<p>"No; but maybe I do know him now&mdash;a little
better than you do," she answered demurely, thinking
of the name that Harold did not even suspect.</p>

<p>School this year, for Genevieve, was meaning
two new experiences. One was that for the first
time class officers were elected; the other, that a
school magazine was started. In both of these she
bore a prominent part. In the one she was unanimously
elected president; in the other she was
appointed correspondent for her class by the Editor-in-Chief.
By each, however, she was quite overwhelmed.</p>

<p>"But I don't think I can do them&mdash;not either
of them," she declared to Mrs. Kennedy and Miss
Jane Chick when she had brought home the news.
"To be Class President you have to be awfully
dignified and conduct meetings and know parliamentary
law, and all that."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of anything <i>there</i> hurting you,"
smiled Miss Jane. "In fact, it strikes me that it
will do you a great deal of good."</p>

<p>"Y-yes, I suppose you would think so," smiled
Genevieve, a little dubiously.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure it's an honor," Mrs. Kennedy reminded
her.</p>

<p>Genevieve flushed.</p>

<p>"I <i>am</i> glad they wanted me," she admitted
frankly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what is this magazine affair?" asked Miss
Jane.</p>

<p>"Yes, and that's another thing," sighed Genevieve.
"I can't write things. If it were only Quentina,
now&mdash;she could do it!"</p>

<p>"But you have written for the Chronicles, my
dear," observed Mrs. Kennedy. "Have you given
those up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; we still keep them, only we have entries
once a week now instead of every day. There isn't
so much doing here as there was in Texas, you
know."</p>

<p>"Then you do write for that," said Miss Jane.</p>

<p>"Oh, but <i>that's</i> just for us," argued Genevieve.
"I don't mind that. But this has got to be printed,
Miss Jane&mdash;printed right out for everybody to
read! If it were only Quentina, now&mdash;she'd glory
in it. And&mdash;oh, Miss Jane, how I wish you could
see Quentina," broke off Genevieve, suddenly.
"Dear me! wouldn't she just hit on your name,
though! She'd be rhyming it in no time, and have
'Miss Jane at the window-pane,' before you could
turn around!"</p>

<p>"Quite an inducement for me to know her, I'm
sure," observed Miss Jane, dryly.</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed, but she sighed again, too.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, she would do it lovely&mdash;this
correspondence business; but I can't, I'm sure."</p>

<p>"What are you supposed to do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, just hand in things&mdash;anything that's of
interest in my class; but I don't know <i>what</i> to
say."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the others can help you," suggested
Aunt Julia.</p>

<p>Genevieve gave a sudden laugh.</p>

<p>"They'd like to&mdash;some of them. Tilly's tried
already. She gave me two items this noon, all
written down. One was that O. B. J. had a new
freckle on the left side of his nose, and the other
that Bertha hadn't said 'I told you so' to-day."</p>

<p>"Genevieve!" protested the shocked Miss Jane.
"You wouldn't&mdash;" She stopped helplessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Miss Jane, I wouldn't," laughed Genevieve,
merrily, as she rose from the dinner-table.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was her duties as president, and her
new task as correspondent, or perhaps it was just
the allurement of the beautiful out-of-doors that
made it so hard for Genevieve to spend time on her
lessons that autumn. Perhaps, too, her lack of
enthusiasm for Miss Hart had something to do
with it. Whatever it was, to concentrate her attention
on Latin verbs and French nouns grew harder
and harder as the days passed, until at last&mdash;in
the frenzied rush of a study-hour one day&mdash;she
did what she had never done before: wrote the
meaning of some of the words under the Latin
version in her book.</p>

<p>It was, apparently, a great success. Her work in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
class was so unusually good that Miss Hart's tired
eyes brightened, and her lips spoke a word of high
praise&mdash;praise that sent to Genevieve's cheek a
flush that Genevieve herself tried to think was all
gratification. But&mdash;the next day she did not write
any words in the book. The out-of-doors, however,
was just as alluring, and the outside duties were
just as pressing; so there was just as little time as
ever for the Latin verbs. They suffered, too, in
consequence. So, also, did Genevieve; for this
time, Miss Hart, stung into irritation by this apparently
unnecessary falling back into carelessness,
said a few particularly sharp words that sent Genevieve
out of the class with very red cheeks and very
angry eyes.</p>

<p>"I just hate Miss Hart and school, and&mdash;and
everything," stormed Genevieve hotly, five minutes
later, as she met Cordelia and Tilly in the corridor
after school was dismissed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve," remonstrated Cordelia, faintly.</p>

<p>"Well, I do. I didn't have time to get that lesson&mdash;but
a lot Miss Hart cared for that!"</p>

<p>"Why don't you use a pony?" twittered Tilly,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>"A&mdash;pony?" Genevieve's eyes were puzzled.</p>

<p>Tilly laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't one of your bronchos," she giggled,
"and it's easier to ride than they are! It's just a
nice little book that you buy&mdash;a Latin translation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
you know, all done by somebody else&mdash;and no
bother to you."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;is that quite&mdash;fair?" frowned Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Hm-m; well, I presume Miss Hartless wouldn't
call it&mdash;good form," she shrugged.</p>

<p>"Why, Tilly Mack! of course it isn't fair, and
you know it," cried Cordelia. "It's worse than
cribbing."</p>

<p>"What's cribbing?" demanded Genevieve.</p>

<p>"It's the only way out when you haven't got
your lesson," answered Tilly, promptly.</p>

<p>"It's writing the translation under the words in
the book," explained Elsie Martin, who, coming
up at the moment, had heard Genevieve's question.</p>

<p>"It's just plain cheating&mdash;and it's horrid," declared
Cordelia, with emphasis.</p>

<p>Genevieve's face turned a sudden, painful red,
for some unapparent reason.</p>

<p>"Y-yes, it must be," she murmured faintly, as
she turned to go.</p>

<p>On the walk home that noon, Harold, as was frequently
the case, overtook her.</p>

<p>"Well, what part of the world would you like
changed to-day?" he asked, with a smiling glance
at her frowning face.</p>

<p>"Chiefly, I reckon I'd like no school," sighed
Genevieve; "but if I can't have that, I'd like another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
box of teachers opened so we could have a
new one."</p>

<p>"What's the trouble now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I reckon the trouble is with me," admitted
Genevieve, ruefully. "Anyhow, Miss Jane would
say it was. I flunked in C&aelig;sar&mdash;but that's no reason
why Miss Hart should have been so disagreeable!
But then, I suppose she has to be. She came
out of that kind of a box, you know."</p>

<p>Harold laughed, though a little gravely.</p>

<p>"You still think they come all boxed, sorted, and
labeled, do you?" he said. "And that they aren't
'just folks' at all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I still think so. They never seem a bit
like 'folks' to me. It's their business to sit up
there stiff and solemn and stern, and see that you
behave and learn your lessons. I never saw one
that I liked, except Miss Palmer and Miss Jones&mdash;but
then, they came out of a jolly box, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Lucky ladies!"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed rebelliously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know I'm horrid," she admitted; "but&mdash;well,
I went off for a ride with Tilly yesterday
after school, instead of paying attention to his Imperial
Highness, C&aelig;sar; and that's what was the
trouble. But, Harold, it was so perfectly glorious
out I had to&mdash;I just had to! I tell you, every bit
of me was tingling to go! Now what do you suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Miss Hart knows of a feeling like that? She
simply couldn't understand it."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;Miss Hart doesn't look very old&mdash;to
me."</p>

<p>Genevieve stopped short, and turned half
around.</p>

<p>"Old! Why, she's a <i>teacher</i>, Harold!"</p>

<p>Harold chuckled, as they started forward again.</p>

<p>"I should like to see some teachers' faces if they
could hear you say 'teacher' in that tone of voice,
young lady!"</p>

<p>"Pooh! I reckon it would take considerable to
make me think of any teacher as <i>young</i>," retorted
Genevieve, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"All right; but&mdash;aren't you coming out, later,
for a walk or&mdash;or something?" asked Harold, a
little anxiously, as they reached the Kennedy driveway.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"No, little boy," she answered, with mock cheerfulness.
"I'm going to practise, then I'm going to
study my algebra, then I'm going to study my Latin,
then I'm going to study my French, then I'm going
to study my English history, then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Good-by!</i>" laughed Harold, clapping his hands
to his ears, and hurrying away.</p>

<p>Unhesitating as was Genevieve's assertion of her
intentions, those intentions were not carried out,
even to the practising, first on the list; for, in putting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
down her books, Genevieve dropped some loose
papers to the floor. The papers were some that had
that day been returned by Miss Hart; and, as the
girl gathered them up now, a sheet of note paper,
covered with handwriting entirely different from
her own, attracted her attention.</p>

<p>She recognized the writing at once as that of
Miss Hart, and she supposed at first that the paper
must contain some special suggestions or criticisms
in regard to her own work. With a quick frown,
therefore, she began to read it.</p>

<p>She had not read five lines before she knew that
the paper did not contain criticism or suggestions.
But so dazed, so surprised, and so absorbed was she,
by that time, that she quite forgot that she was
reading something most certainly never meant for
her eyes to see.</p>

<p>The paper was evidently the second sheet of a
letter. The writing&mdash;fine, but plain&mdash;began close
to the top of the first page, in what was apparently
the middle of a sentence.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"speak freely, I am sure.</p>

<p>"Things are not getting any better, but rather
worse. I cannot seem to win them. Of course I
understood that my task would be difficult, following,
as I did, two such popular teachers. I think,
perhaps, that this very fact has made me nervous;
and so&mdash;I have not appeared even at my best.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
But, oh, I have tried!&mdash;you cannot know how I
have tried!</p>

<p>"I am nearly sick with terror for fear I shall lose
my position&mdash;and of course <i>that</i> doesn't help me
to be the cool, calm, judicious person in the chair
I ought to be. But it means so much to me&mdash;this
place&mdash;and if I should lose it, there would be poor
Annie deprived of her comforts again; for, of
course, a failure here would mean that not for a
long time (if ever!) could I get another like it.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for burdening you with all this,
but it had got to the point where I must speak to
some one. Then, too, I did not know but you could
perhaps tell me why I have failed&mdash;I have tried so
hard myself to understand!</p>

<p>"Sometimes I think I'm too lenient. Sometimes
I think I'm too strict. Sometimes I'm so worried
for fear they'll think me too young and inexperienced,
that I don't dare to act myself at all&mdash;then
I'm stiffly dignified in a way that I know must be
horrid.</p>

<p>"After all, I think the whole secret of the matter
is&mdash;that I'm afraid. If once I could have a confident
assurance that I <i>am</i> doing well, and that I
<i>am</i> winning out&mdash;I think I should win out. I do,
truly!</p>

<p>"And now I must stop and go to work. I'm in
the grove, back of the schoolhouse. I often bring
my papers here to correct. I have them with me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to-night; but&mdash;I've been writing to you instead
of working. I'll finish this later. But, really, already
I feel a little better. It's done me good, just
to say things to you. Of course, to no one else
could I&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>There was a little more, but Genevieve stopped
here. Not until she read that last sentence did she
realize in the least what she was doing. Then, hurriedly,
with flushed cheeks and shamed eyes, she
thrust the letter out of sight under the papers. But
there was something besides shame in her eyes;
there was a very real, and a very tender sympathy
for&mdash;folks.</p>

<p>"And to think that I&mdash;read it," she breathed.
Then, suddenly, she snatched up the papers again.
"But she mustn't know&mdash;she <i>mustn't</i> know,"
choked the girl. "Maybe, if I run, I can get there
in time and tuck it into her desk. I <i>must</i> get there
in time," she declared aloud, darting out of the
house and up the street without once looking back
toward an amazed Miss Jane, watching her from
the window.</p>

<p>As Genevieve hoped would be the case, the janitor
had not finished his nightly duties. The great front
door stood wide open, and Genevieve made short
work of reaching her own room. As she opened
that door, however, she paused in dismay.</p>

<p>Miss Hart was in her chair. Her arms lay folded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
on the desk before her, and her face was hidden in
them.</p>

<p>The knob under Genevieve's nerveless fingers
clicked sharply, and Miss Hart raised her head with
a start.</p>

<p>During the one brief moment that Genevieve
gazed into her teacher's startled eyes, wild plans
raced through her mind: she would run; she would
go to her own desk and leave the papers, then destroy
the fateful letter to-morrow; she would walk
up and hand the letter to Miss Hart now, and confess
that she had read it; she would&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Genevieve!" cried Miss Hart, a little
huskily. "Did you&mdash;forget something?"</p>

<p>"No, Miss Hart; yes&mdash;well, I mean&mdash;it isn't
that I <i>forgot</i> exactly. I&mdash;I didn't know," she faltered,
realizing more than ever the meaning of the
letter she had just read, now that the wistful-eyed
writer of it sat before her, bearing plain evidence of
tears.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you?" Miss Hart asked.</p>

<p>Genevieve went, then, straight to the desk. The
papers&mdash;with the letter&mdash;were rolled tightly in
one hand.</p>

<p>"No, Miss Hart, thank you; but&mdash;isn't there
something that&mdash;that I can do for&mdash;you?" she
faltered.</p>

<p>What happened next was, to Genevieve, certainly,
most disconcerting. Miss Hart gave one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
look into Genevieve's eyes, then dropped her face
into her hands and burst into tears. At Genevieve's
aghast exclamation, however, she raised her head
determinedly and began to wipe her eyes.</p>

<p>"There, there, my dear," she smiled brightly,
winking off the tears. "That was very foolish and
very silly of me, and you must forget all about it.
I was a little homesick, I'm afraid, and perhaps a
bit blue; and your eyes looked into mine so frankly
and honestly, and with such a courageous 'I'll-try-to-help-you'
look, that&mdash;that&mdash;well, you know
what I did. But come&mdash;let us talk no more of this,
my dear! Let us get out of this stifling room, and
into the blessed out-of-doors. We'll go into the
grove for a little walk. These four walls have been
just smothering me all day!"</p>

<p>Genevieve opened wide her eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, do <i>you</i> feel that way&mdash;too?" she asked
incredulously.</p>

<p>Miss Hart colored a little.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I do, my dear&mdash;though probably I
ought not to have said just that&mdash;to you," she
sighed constrainedly. "But&mdash;to tell the truth,
I've never been able quite to see what houses were
made for, I suspect, since I used to ask that question
as a little girl. I imagine 'twas in summer,
however, not winter, when I asked it," she finished
a little tremulously, as they passed through the hall
to the outer door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Once again Genevieve opened wide her eyes.</p>

<p>"Did you ask that&mdash;really? Why, Father says
that was one of <i>my</i> questions, too," she breathed
rapturously. "Why, you are&mdash;you are just
like&mdash;" with a little cough Genevieve choked off
the "folks" before it was spoken. The word was
"me" when it finally left her lips.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful half-hour that Genevieve
spent then in the grove. Over in the west the sun
was low, and the shadows were long under the
trees. The air was crisp, but not too crisp, if one
were walking&mdash;and she and Miss Hart were walking.
They were talking, too.</p>

<p>They talked of birds and beasts and flowers.
They talked of school and study, and Latin lessons
that were so hard to learn when the out-of-doors
called. They talked of the days and lessons to
come; and they spoke&mdash;at least, Miss Hart did&mdash;of
what fine work Genevieve was sure to do before
the year was through. They did not talk, however,
of Miss Hart's tears in the classroom, nor of Miss
Hart's letter still tightly clutched in Genevieve's
hand.</p>

<p>Genevieve, however, had not forgotten the letter;
and when she walked alone toward home, a little
later, she wondered what she should do with it. To
give it openly back to Miss Hart, she felt was not
to be thought of; at the same time she doubted if
in any other way she could return it to her now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
The letter certainly had already accomplished two
things: never again would she so misjudge Miss
Hart; never again, too, would she let the others
so misjudge her, if she could help it&mdash;and she
believed she could help it. She should try, certainly.
As for the letter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, Miss," broke in Harold's slightly aggrieved
voice behind her, "is <i>this</i> the way you
practise, and study your Latin and your French and
your algebra and your English history?"</p>

<p>Genevieve was too absorbed even to notice the
taunt, much less to reply to it.</p>

<p>"Harold," she sighed, "I wish you'd tell me
something."</p>

<p>"Certainly! You have only to command me,"
bowed the lad, with mock pomposity, as he fell into
step with her.</p>

<p>Genevieve was frowning. She did not even
smile.</p>

<p>"Harold, if you had something that belonged to
somebody else, and they didn't know you had it
and would feel dreadfully if they found out you
had it, do you think you ought to give it back to
them, and so let them know you had it, when all
the time if they <i>didn't</i> know you had it, they
wouldn't care at all?"</p>

<p>"W-w-well!" whistled Harold. "Do you mind&mdash;er&mdash;giving
me that again, now&mdash;say, in pieces
a foot long this time? If I were Cordelia I might<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
give you my answer right off the handle, but&mdash;I'm
not Cordelia, you see."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed a little ruefully.</p>

<p>"There wouldn't anybody know, of course, unless
I told the rest; and I can't tell the rest."</p>

<p>"Maybe not," smiled Harold, oddly; "but I'll
wager you'll have to be telling something to Miss
Jane pretty quick now. I saw you when you flew
out of the yard an hour ago, and I fancy Miss Jane
must have seen you, too. At any rate, she's been
to the door three times since, to my knowledge, to
look for you."</p>

<p>Genevieve clapped her hand to her lips.</p>

<p>"Mercy! I never thought to tell them a word.
I just ran."</p>

<p>"Yes, I noticed you&mdash;ran," observed Harold,
dryly.</p>

<p>"And they always want to know just where I
am," sighed Genevieve. "O dear! if you do something
bad in order to do something good, which is
it&mdash;bad or good?"</p>

<p>Harold shook his head.</p>

<p>"That's not in mine, either," he retorted whimsically.
"Really, Miss, your questions on ethics
this afternoon do you credit&mdash;but they're too much
for me."</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon this one is for me," sighed
Genevieve again, as she came in sight of the house
and saw Miss Jane Chick at the window. "But the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
other one&mdash;I know the answer to that. I shall
burn it up," she said decisively, clutching even more
tightly the roll of papers in her hand, as she turned
in at the Kennedys' front walk.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>A TEXAS "MISSIONARY"</h3>


<p>October passed and November came. School
was decidedly more bearable now, in the opinion of
Genevieve, perhaps because it was a rainy month;
but Genevieve preferred to think it was because of
Miss Hart. It was strange, really, how much Miss
Hart had improved as a teacher!&mdash;all the school
agreed to that. Even Tilly ceased to call her "Hartless."</p>

<p>"Maybe she came in a jolly box, after all,"
Harold said one day to Genevieve; but Genevieve
tossed her head.</p>

<p>"Pooh! She wasn't in any box at all, Harold.
She's&mdash;<i>folks!</i>" And Harold saw that, in spite of
the lightness of her words, there were almost tears
in Genevieve's eyes.</p>

<p>Presidential duties, too, were easier for Genevieve
now. They proved to be, in fact, very far from
arduous; and, as Tilly declared, they were, indeed,
"dreadfully honorable."</p>

<p>As correspondent for the school magazine Genevieve
did not feel herself to be a success. She wrote
few items, and sent in even fewer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Those she did write represented hours of labor,
however; for she felt that the weight of nations
lay on every word, and she wrote and rewrote the
poor little sentences until every vestige of naturalness
and of spontaneity were taken out of them.
Such information as she could gather seemed always,
in her eyes, either too frivolous to be worth
notice, or too serious to be of interest. And ever
before her frightened eyes loomed the bugbear of
PRINT.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was during the short vacation of three days at
Thanksgiving time that Nancy, the second girl at
the Kennedys', came to the parlor door one afternoon
and interrupted Genevieve's practising.</p>

<p>"Miss Genevieve, I do be hatin' ter tell ye," she
began indignantly, "but there's a man at the side
door on horseback what is insistin' on seein' of ye;
and Mis' Kennedy and Miss Jane ain't home from
town yet."</p>

<p>"Why, Nancy, who is the man?"</p>

<p>"I ain't sayin' that I know, Miss, but I do say
that he is powerful rough-lookin' to come to the
likes o' this house a-claimin' he's Mis' Granger's
cousin, as he does."</p>

<p>"Reddy! Why, of course I'll see Reddy," cried
Genevieve, springing to her feet.</p>

<p>A minute later, to Nancy's vast displeasure, Genevieve
was ushering into the sitting room a sandy-haired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
man in full cowboy costume from broad-brimmed
hat and flannel shirt to chaparejos and
high-heeled boots.</p>

<p>Reddy evidently saw the surprise in Genevieve's
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," he smiled sheepishly, as Nancy
left the room with slow reluctance, "I reckon you're
surprised to see me in this rig, and I'll own I hain't
wore 'em much since I came; but to-day, to come
to see you, I just had to. You see, Miss Genevieve,
it's what this 'ere rig stands for that I want to see
you about, anyhow."</p>

<p>"About&mdash;this&mdash;rig?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;in a way. It's about the West."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's Martha&mdash;Mis' Granger, my cousin. I want
her to go back with me. She's all alone, and so am
I. And she'd come in a minute, but she's&mdash;afraid."</p>

<p>"What of?"</p>

<p>Reddy's lips twitched.</p>

<p>"Indians and prairie fires and bucking bronchos
and buffaloes. She thinks all of 'em run 'round
loose all the time&mdash;in Texas."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed merrily.</p>

<p>"The idea! Haven't you told her they don't?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; and I've come to see if <i>you</i> won't tell
her."</p>

<p>"I!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. She thinks I'm a man and rough anyhow,
so I don't count. <i>Would</i> you be willing to
come and talk Texas to her?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I will," cried Genevieve. "I'll
come right away to-day, after I've finished my
hour."</p>

<p>"Thank you," sighed Reddy, rising to his feet.
"Now I'll hit the trail for Texas inside of a month&mdash;you
see if I don't! What <i>you</i> say will go."</p>

<p>"Oh, but don't be too sure of that, Reddy,"
frowned Genevieve, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I ain't. I'm just <i>sure</i>&mdash;and that's all right,"
retorted Reddy, cheerfully. "And mighty glad I
shall be to get there, too! I'd be plum locoed here
in another month. You see, I've got some money
now, and I know a nice little place I can buy cheap,
to start in for myself. Martha'll take Jim Small's
girl, 'Mandy, for company and to help. You see
we've got her already roped."</p>

<p>"She wants to go, then?"</p>

<p>"Dyin' to. It all depends on you now, Miss
Genevieve."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll be there," promised the girl,
laughingly, as Reddy, watched by Nancy's disapproving
eyes from the kitchen window, swung himself
into the saddle and galloped down the driveway.</p>

<p>A little later Genevieve met Mrs. Kennedy and
Miss Chick at the foot of the front walk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've taken my music lesson and done my hour,
and I'm off on missionary work now," she beamed
brightly. "I knew you'd let me go, so I didn't
wait till you came home."</p>

<p>"Missionary work?" frowned Miss Chick.</p>

<p>"Why, what do you mean?" questioned Mrs.
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Genevieve chuckled.</p>

<p>"It's to teach Mrs. Granger that Texas has something
besides bucking bronchos and prairie fires.
You see, Reddy wants to take her West, and she's
afraid. She thinks those things, and Indians and
buffaloes, are all that grow there. So I'm going to
tell her a thing or two," she finished with a nod
and a smile.</p>

<p>Just how successful Genevieve was with her missionary
work perhaps she herself did not realize
until nearly a fortnight later, when Cordelia Wilson
overtook her on the way to school one
morning.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, Genevieve, please," panted Cordelia.
"I want you to do some missionary work for me!
Will you?"</p>

<p>Genevieve turned in surprise.</p>

<p>"'Missionary work!' What <i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>Cordelia laughed and colored.</p>

<p>"Well, it's what you did for Mrs. Granger.
Reddy told me. He said you called it missionary
work&mdash;and that <i>'twas</i> missionary work, too. You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
know they're to start next week, and they're all so
happy over it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," nodded Genevieve; "and I'm so
glad!"</p>

<p>"So am I," sighed the other, fervently. "You
see, Reddy being my find, so, I felt responsible;
and of course I ought to feel that way, too. Just
think&mdash;what if they weren't happy over it!"</p>

<p>"But they are," smiled Genevieve. "What's the
use of 'if-ing' a thing when it just <i>is</i> already?"</p>

<p>"What?" Cordelia's eyes were slightly puzzled.
"Oh, I see," she laughed. "What a funny way
you do have of putting things, Genevieve Hartley!
Why don't you say such things as that in your notes
for the magazine?"</p>

<p>"In the magazine?&mdash;mercy! Why, Cordelia,
they're <i>printed!</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?" maintained Cordelia.</p>

<p>"What of what?" chirped a new voice; and
Tilly Mack hurried up from behind them.</p>

<p>Cordelia looked plainly disappointed; but Genevieve
turned with a light laugh.</p>

<p>"My magazine notes, Tilly. Cordelia doesn't
like them," she explained.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Genevieve, it's only that I want you to
write as you talk," supplemented Cordelia, in distress.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. I'm sure&mdash;aren't they
true?" bridled Genevieve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>"True!" giggled Tilly, suddenly. "Oh, yes,
they're true, just as 'c-a-t spells cat' is true&mdash;and
they sound just about like that, too, Genevieve
Hartley, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Humph! I like that," bridled Genevieve, again.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tilly, she writes lovely notes&mdash;you know
she does," championed Cordelia, almost tearfully.</p>

<p>"No, I don't write lovely notes," disputed Genevieve,
with unexpected frankness. "They're just
like Tilly says they are, and they're horrid. I <i>do</i>
say 'c-a-t spells cat' every time&mdash;but I simply
can't seem to say anything else!"</p>

<p>"But why don't you write as you talk?" argued
Tilly.</p>

<p>"Or as you do in the Chronicles?" added Cordelia.
"You write just beautifully there."</p>

<p>"But, Cordelia, that isn't <i>printed</i>," cried Genevieve,
again, as they came in sight of the school
building and saw Elsie Martin coming to meet them.</p>

<p>At the doorway of the classroom Cordelia whispered
to Genevieve:</p>

<p>"Please wait after school for me. I'll tell you
then&mdash;about the missionary work, you know."
And Genevieve nodded assent.</p>

<p>Once or twice during the day, Genevieve wondered
what Cordelia's missionary work could be;
but for the most part study and recitation filled her
thoughts and time. Mid-year examinations were
approaching, and, in spite of the fact that she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
been doing much better work for the last month,
she felt by no means sure of herself for the dreaded
ordeal. It was of this she was thinking when she
met Cordelia according to agreement at the close
of the short afternoon session.</p>

<p>"Here I am, dear," she sighed; "but, really, I
reckon <i>I'm</i> the one that needs the missionary work
if any one does&mdash;with those horrid exams looming
up before me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you've been doing such splendid work&mdash;lately!"
cried Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Thank you," retorted Genevieve, wrinkling up
her nose saucily at the pause before the "lately."
"I perceive you still know how to tell the truth,
Miss!"</p>

<p>"Genevieve!" protested Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Oh, then you mean it wasn't the truth," bantered
her friend.</p>

<p>"Genevieve!" groaned Cordelia, hopelessly.</p>

<p>"There, there, never mind," laughed the other.
"Come, we must be running along; then you shall
tell me all about this wonderful missionary work
of yours. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it&mdash;it's about another of my&mdash;my
finds."</p>

<p>"Oh, your lost people?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It's John Sanborn, Hermit Joe's son,
you know. He wants to go West and take his
father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, can't he? Or doesn't his father want
to? Maybe you want me to go and tell Hermit Joe
not to be afraid of bronchos and buffaloes,"
laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>A swift color stole into Cordelia's face.</p>

<p>"No; Hermit Joe wants to go."</p>

<p>"Then what is it?"</p>

<p>Cordelia laughed shyly.</p>

<p>"Well, it&mdash;it's a lady, Genevieve."</p>

<p>"A lady! Why, Hermit Joe and his son haven't
any&mdash;any women or cousins, have they?"</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;but they want one," admitted Cordelia,
a little breathlessly.</p>

<p>Genevieve stopped short.</p>

<p>"Cordelia, what <i>are</i> you talking about?" she
demanded.</p>

<p>Cordelia laughed softly, but she grew suddenly
very pink indeed, and she clasped her hands rapturously.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Genevieve. I've been just longing
to tell you, every minute. It's the loveliest thing&mdash;just
like a book! It seems Hermit Joe's son, years
ago, before he ran away, had a sweetheart, Miss
Sally Hunt."</p>

<p>"That little old maid on Hunt's Hill? She's a
dear, I think!"</p>

<p>"Yes; but she wasn't old then, you know. She
was young, and so pretty! She showed me her
picture, once&mdash;how she looked then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;go on!"</p>

<p>"Well, they were sweethearts, but they had a
quarrel or something, and&mdash;anyhow, Mr. John
Sanborn ran away."</p>

<p>"How long ago?"</p>

<p>"Twenty years; and now he's back, and they've
made everything all up lovely, and he wants to
marry her and take her West."</p>

<p>"Oh-h!" breathed Genevieve. "It <i>is</i> just like a
story; isn't it? And didn't it turn out lovely!"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, only it hasn't turned out yet."</p>

<p>"What's the matter? I thought you said they'd
made it all up!"</p>

<p>"They have. She'll marry him; but she&mdash;she's
afraid of Texas, too, just as Mrs. Granger was, I
guess."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," cried Genevieve. "Pooh! We'll
fix that in no time," finished the Texas "missionary,"
with confidence.</p>

<p>"There, I knew you would," sighed her friend,
blissfully. "You see, I specially wanted Miss
Sally to be happy, because I couldn't find&mdash;"
Cordelia caught herself up in time. She must not,
of course, tell Genevieve about Sally Hunt's lost
brother whom she had failed to find. "Well, you
know, anyway, Sally Hunt is very poor," she explained
hastily; "and everybody said, when we
went to Texas last summer, that she'd have to go
to the Poor Farm soon, if something wasn't done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
So I'm specially glad to have her happy, and&mdash;"
Cordelia stopped, and turned to Genevieve with a
new look in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, I've just remembered," she cried.
"At the ranch last summer, when I was talking to
Mr. Jonathan Edwards and didn't know his name
was 'Sanborn'&mdash;I've just remembered that I told
him about Miss Sally, and how she'd have to go to
the Poor Farm. Genevieve, I'm sure&mdash;I just
know that's one reason why he came home!"</p>

<p>"Of course it was," agreed Genevieve, excitedly;
"and we'll go straight up there now, if Aunt Julia'll
let us; only&mdash;" her face fell&mdash;"Cordelia, when
<i>shall</i> I get in my studying?"</p>

<p>"To-night, Genevieve; you must study to-night,"
answered Cordelia, firmly. "You mustn't
sacrifice your studies, even for missionary work.
Uncle always says it isn't right to send money to
the heathen when your own child is hungry; and
I'm sure this is the same thing. Maybe we can go
Saturday morning, though," she finished hopefully.</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can," declared Genevieve; "and
I'm just as excited as I can be. I just love missionary
work," she exulted, as she waved her hand in
farewell, at her street corner.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>GENEVIEVE GOES TO BOSTON</h3>


<p>December was a busy month, indeed. To Genevieve
it seemed actually to be one whirl of study,
lessons, practice, and examinations, leaving oh, so
little time for Christmas gifts and plans.</p>

<p>A big box was to go to the Six Star Ranch, and
a smaller one to Quentina. But, better than all,
Mr. Jones was to have a letter from Mrs. Kennedy
which would&mdash;Genevieve was sure&mdash;carry a
wonderful happiness to Quentina. Mrs. Kennedy
was to ask Mr. Jones to let Quentina come to Sunbridge
to school the next winter, and share Genevieve's
room, as Mrs. Kennedy's guest. All other
expenses, railroad fare, school supplies, and any
special instruction, were to be met by Mr. Hartley
through Genevieve herself.</p>

<p>All this, of course, Genevieve had not brought
about without many letters to Mr. Hartley, and
many talks with Mrs. Kennedy and Miss Chick,
wherein all sorts of pleadings and promises had a
part. But it had been done at last, and the letter
was to go in the Christmas box&mdash;but of all this the
Happy Hexagons were not to know until the answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
from Mr. Jones came. Naturally, however,
Genevieve could not keep all her attention on her
studies that month, in spite of the coming examinations.</p>

<p>There was, too, more than one visit to the gentle
spinster on Hunt's Hill before Genevieve quite succeeded
in convincing Miss Sally that there <i>were</i>
places in Texas where wild Indians did not prowl,
nor wild horses race neck and neck across vast
deserts of loneliness. At last, however, she had
the satisfaction of hearing from John Sanborn's
own grateful lips that everything was all right,
and that the wedding day was set for April the
tenth.</p>

<p>In the midst of all this came the dreaded examinations,
then the fearful waiting till the last day of
school when the decision would be announced. The
winter before, at these mid-year examinations,
Genevieve had not passed. She had not forgotten
the mortification of that tragedy, nor the weary
weeks of study that had been necessary to enable
her to go on with her class. So she, of all the girls
now, was awaiting the verdict with special anxiety.
Meanwhile, all the Happy Hexagons were spending
every available minute on Christmas gifts.</p>

<p>It was just a week before Christmas Day that
Genevieve was surprised to receive a hurried after-school
call from Cordelia.</p>

<p>"Genevieve&mdash;quick!" panted Cordelia, dropping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
herself into the first chair she came to. "Can't
we do something? We <i>must</i> do something!"</p>

<p>"Of course we can," laughed Genevieve,
promptly; "but&mdash;what about?"</p>

<p>Cordelia gave a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; I wasn't very explicit," she
sighed. "But, listen. You know&mdash;or maybe
you didn't know&mdash;but the Missionary Society
have been packing a barrel to go West. They're
at the church this afternoon, packing it; but they
didn't have half enough, and they sent down to the
parsonage to know if Aunt Mary hadn't something
more&mdash;some old clothes of the children's, or old
magazines, or anything. Auntie's sick to-day with
an awful cold, but she went up attic and hunted up
all she could; then after I got home from school
she asked me to take them down to the church."</p>

<p>"Yes, go on," prompted Genevieve, as Cordelia
paused for breath.</p>

<p>"Well, I took them; and, Genevieve, what do
you think?"&mdash;Cordelia's voice was tragic&mdash;"that
missionary barrel was going to the Rev.
Luke Jones, Bolo, Texas. <i>Our</i> Mr. Jones,&mdash;Quentina!"</p>

<p>"Cordelia! Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You know they told us they got them
from our church sometimes. And, Genevieve, it
was awful&mdash;that barrel! It looked just like the
other one, the one they got while we were there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
that day&mdash;old shoes and dolls, and <i>homely</i>
things!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cordelia! What did you do?"</p>

<p>Cordelia drew in her breath with a little gasp.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I talked. I said things&mdash;awful
things. I know they were awful things from the
looks of some of their faces. And at the last Mrs.
Johnson&mdash;you <i>know</i> how she can be sometimes!&mdash;she&mdash;she
just snapped out: 'Very well, Miss Cordelia,
if you are not satisfied with what we have
been able to procure after weeks of hard work, suppose
you go out yourself and solicit gifts for your
friends!' And, Genevieve, I said I would. And I
turned 'round and marched out. And now&mdash;now&mdash;what
<i>shall</i> we do?"</p>

<p>Genevieve sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>"Do? Why, we'll do it, of course," she cried.</p>

<p>"But, Genevieve, I'm so scared. What if folks
won't give&mdash;anything? Those women worked
weeks&mdash;they said they did&mdash;for what they've
got!"</p>

<p>"But folks <i>will</i> give," declared Genevieve, with
prompt confidence. "Now wait. I'll have to tell
Aunt Julia where I'm going, then I'll be back ready
to start," she finished, as she whisked out of the
room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve, you're always so comfortingly
<i>sure</i>," sighed Cordelia to the door through which
her friend had just sped.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>During the next two hours Sunbridge, as represented
by many of its most staid and stately homes,
received the surprise of its life&mdash;a surprise that
sent hitherto complacently contented women scurrying
into attics and closets, and stirred reputedly
miserly men into thrusting hands into inside
pockets for spare bills.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the sight of the eager young faces,
alight with generous enthusiasm. Perhaps it was
the pathos of the story of one missionary barrel as
told by girlish lips trembling with feeling. Perhaps
it was just the novelty of receiving so direct,
and so confident an appeal for "something you'd
like to have given to you, you know." Perhaps it
was a little of all three that worked the miracle.
At all events, in the church parlor some time later,
a little band of excited, marveling women worked
until far into the evening packing a missionary
barrel for the Rev. Luke Jones. And when it left
their hands, there was in it the pretty dress for the
minister's wife, the unworn underclothing for the
minister's boys, the fresh hair-ribbons for the minister's
daughter, and the serviceable coat for the
minister himself, to say nothing of uncounted
books, games, and household articles of a worth
and desirability likely to make a missionary minister's
family exclaim with surprise and delight&mdash;until
they found the generous roll of bills in the
minister's coat pocket, when they would be dumb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
with a great wave of reverent gratitude to a God
who could make human hearts so kind.</p>

<p>"There!" sighed Genevieve, when she and Cordelia
had left their last parcels at the church door.
"I reckon we've got something different for that
barrel now&mdash;but we'll never let Quentina know,
<i>never</i>&mdash;that we had a thing to do with packing it."</p>

<p>"No; but I guess she'll suspect it, though," returned
Cordelia, with a teary smile. "But, oh,
Genevieve, didn't they give just splendidly!"</p>

<p>"I knew they would," declared Genevieve, "if
they just understood."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I wish they'd&mdash;understand
oftener," sighed Cordelia, as she turned down her
street.</p>

<p>Two days later the Happy Hexagons were holding
a hurried meeting at the parsonage after school.
It was the night before the last day of the term,
and they were all trying to work at once on the
sofa pillow they had planned to give Miss Hart.
Cordelia was making the tassel for one corner, and
Alma Lane one for another. The other two tassels
were being sewed on by Elsie and Bertha. Tilly
was writing the card to go with it, and Genevieve
was holding the paper and ribbon with which to do
it up.</p>

<p>"I'm going to do as Miss Jane does, next year,"
sighed Genevieve, at last.</p>

<p>"And what does Miss Jane do?" asked Tilly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"Begins in January to get ready for Christmas.
Now I've got exactly seventy-nine and one things
to do before next Tuesday&mdash;and to-day is Thursday."</p>

<p>"You must have spent part of your valuable time
counting them," teased Tilly, "to have figured them
down so fine as that."</p>

<p>"Seventy-nine and one are eighty," observed
Cordelia, with a little frown. "Why didn't you
say eighty to begin with, Genevieve?"</p>

<p>"Because she wanted to give your brain something
to do, too," explained Tilly, wearing an exaggeratedly
innocent air.</p>

<p>"Tilly!" scolded Genevieve. But Tilly only
laughed, and Cordelia forgot her question with the
last stitch she put into her tassel.</p>

<p>The pillow was given to Miss Hart the next day,
and, apparently, made the lady very happy. Nor
was Miss Hart the only one that was made happy
that day. Genevieve, and in fact, all the Happy
Hexagons, together with O. B. J. Holmes and
nearly all the rest of the class, knew before night
that they had "passed"&mdash;which is no small thing
to know, when for days you have worried and for
nights you have dreamed about the dreadful alternative
of a contrary verdict.</p>

<p>With Miss Jane Chick, Genevieve went to Boston
shopping, Saturday, coming back tired, but
happy, and all aglow with the holiday rush and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
color of the crowded streets and stores. On Sunday
came the beautiful Christmas service, which
Mr. Wilson made very impressive. Certainly it
touched Genevieve's heart deeply, as she sat by
Mrs. Kennedy's side and listened to it. It seemed
so easy to Genevieve, at that moment, always to be
good and brave and true&mdash;always to be thoughtful
of others' wishes&mdash;never to be heedless, careless, or
impulsively reckless of consequences!</p>

<p>It was snowing when she left the church, and it
snowed hard all the afternoon and until far into the
night. Genevieve awoke to look out on a spotlessly
white, crystal-pure world, with every ugly line and
dreary prospect changed into fairylike beauty.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh, isn't it lovely!" she exclaimed,
as she came into the dining-room that morning.
"Don't I wish Quentina were here to see it&mdash;and
to talk about it!"</p>

<p>"We'll hope she will be some day," smiled Mrs.
Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, 'Here's Miss Jane at the window-pane'
all ready for her," chanted Genevieve, merrily,
her eyes on the tall figure in the bay window.</p>

<p>Miss Jane turned with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's very lovely, of course, Genevieve&mdash;but
I must confess it isn't lovely to me this morning."</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Jane!"</p>

<p>"I had planned to go to Boston. In fact it seems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
as if I must go. But I have waked up with a sore
throat and every evidence of a bad cold; and I'm
afraid I don't dare to go&mdash;not with all this new
snow on the ground and dampness in the air."</p>

<p>"Couldn't I go, Miss Jane? I was going to ask
to go, anyway. I find there are three more things
I want to get, and I know I can't find them here."</p>

<p>"But you have never been to Boston alone, my
dear."</p>

<p>"I suppose everybody has to have a first time,"
laughed Genevieve; "and I'm not a mite afraid.
Besides, I know the way perfectly, all through the
shopping district; and all I have to do then is just
to take the car for the North Station and the
train home. I reckon I know how to do <i>that</i>
all right!"</p>

<p>Miss Jane frowned and shook her head slowly.</p>

<p>"I know; but&mdash;I hate to let you do it, Genevieve,
only I&mdash;it seems as if I <i>must</i> go myself!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy looked up reassuringly.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Jane, I am inclined to think Genevieve
can go all right," she smiled. "She has been to
Boston now many times, you know."</p>

<p>"There, Miss Jane!" crowed Genevieve, triumphantly.
"You see! Please, now," she begged.</p>

<p>Miss Jane still frowned&mdash;but a look of almost
reluctant relief came to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Very well," she conceded slowly. "Perhaps,
my dear, I will let you go for me, then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Miss Jane&mdash;besides, there are
several things I want for myself."</p>

<p>"Very well, dear. I have three things that must
be changed, and there are two that I want you to
buy. It seems so absurd&mdash;when I began last January&mdash;that
there should be anything to be done
to-day; but, unfortunately, some of my plans had
to be changed at the last moment. You may get
ready at once after breakfast, please, then come to
my room. I'll have the list all made out for you.
You'll have to bring everything home, of course,
but they are not very heavy, and you can carry
them all in the large hand bag, I think. You'd
better take the nine-four train."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was not quite half-past ten when Genevieve
arrived in the great Boston station that morning.
She glanced importantly at her pretty little watch,
took a firmer hold on the large leather bag she carried,
and stepped briskly off toward her car.</p>

<p>It was delightful&mdash;this independent feeling of
freedom. Even to pay her fare and to signal the
conductor to stop were Events. Shopping, all by
herself, was even more delightful; so she dallied
over every purchase and every exchange as long as
she could&mdash;and it was not hard to dally, with the
crowds, the long waits, and the delays for change.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, when in state she ate her luncheon
at a pretty white table in a large department-store<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
dining-room, she had not half finished her task.
She was so glad there was still so much to do!
But at four o'clock, when she did finish, she looked
at her watch with faintly troubled eyes. She had
not, indeed, realized that it was quite so late. She
remembered, too, suddenly, for the first time, that
Miss Chick had told her to come back early. She
wondered&mdash;could she catch the four-twenty train?</p>

<p>Stores and sidewalks were a mass of surging,
thronging humanity now, and progress was slow
and uncertain. When, at ten minutes past four,
she had not succeeded even in reaching her car for
the station, she gave up the four-twenty train.
Well, there was one at five-fifteen, she comforted
herself. She could surely get that.</p>

<p>The streets were darkening fast, and lights were
beginning to flash here and there, finding a brilliant
response in tinsel stars and crystal pendants. With
the Christmas red and green, and the thronging
crowds, it made a pretty sight; and Genevieve
stopped more than once just to look about her with
a deep breath of delight. It was at such a time
that she saw the small ragged boy, and the still
smaller, still more ragged girl wistfully gazing
into the fairyland of a toyshop window.</p>

<p>"I choose the fire engine, the big red one," she
heard a shrill voice pipe; and she looked down to
see that it was the boy's blue lips that had uttered
the words.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<p>"I d-druther have that d-doll," chattered the
mite of a girl; "an' that teeny little bedstead an'
the chair what rocks, an' the baby trunk, an' the
doll with curly hair, an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gee! look at the autymobile," cut in the boy,
excitedly. "Say, if I had that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, you shall have it, you poor little mite,&mdash;or
one just like it," cried Genevieve impulsively,
sweeping the astonished children into the circle of
her arm, and hurrying them into the store.</p>

<p>They did not get the "autymobile" nor yet the
engine nor the big doll. Genevieve selected them,
to be sure, with blithe promptness; but when she
took out her purse, she found she had not half
money enough to pay for them, which mortified
and disappointed her greatly.</p>

<p>"Dear, dear!" she laughed, blushing painfully.
"I'm afraid I can't manage it, after all, chickabiddies.
That horrid money of mine has given out!
I bought more things than I meant to, anyhow.
Never mind, we'll get all we can," she cried, emptying
her little purse on the counter, even shaking it
to make sure no lurking penny stayed behind.
"There, you'll have to make that do," she said to
the amazed clerk behind the counter. "Just please
give them whatever you can for that." And the
clerk, counting out one dollar and eighty-three
cents, obeyed her literally.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, two dazed, but blissfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
happy children clasping in their arms a motley array
of toys, and a laughing, bright-faced girl with a
tan leather bag, joined the hurrying throng on the
street.</p>

<p>"Good-by, chickabiddies, and good luck to you,"
called Genevieve, waving her hand in farewell to
the children, as she spied her car in the distance.</p>

<p>"Poor little midgets!" thought Genevieve, as she
stepped on to the car; "I don't think now they
really believe they've got those things. But I do
wish I could have bought all those first things they
selected!" A moment later she took out her purse
to pay her fare.</p>

<p>The conductor, coming toward her just then, saw
her face turn red, then white. The next minute she
was on her feet, hurrying toward him.</p>

<p>"Fare, please," he said mechanically, holding out
his hand.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't want this car," she stammered
faintly. "If you'll&mdash;stop, please." A moment
later she rushed blindly through the door and down
the steps to the street.</p>

<p>Genevieve was thoroughly angry, and very much
ashamed.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 313px;">
<img src="images/gs06.jpg" width="313" height="356" alt="&quot;IT WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A WALK, THE WOMAN SAID, AS SHE GAVE DIRECTIONS&quot;" title="&quot;IT WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A WALK, THE WOMAN SAID, AS SHE GAVE DIRECTIONS&quot;" />
<span class="caption">&quot;IT WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A WALK, THE WOMAN SAID, AS SHE GAVE DIRECTIONS&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Now I reckon I've done it," she muttered half
aloud. "No wonder they say I never stop to think!
Seems to me I might have thought to save a nickel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
for my car-fare, though! Never mind, I'll walk it.
Serves me right, anyhow, I reckon!" And determinedly
she turned toward a woman near her and
asked the way to the North Station.</p>

<p>It would be something of a walk, the woman said,
as she gave directions; but Genevieve declared she
did not mind that. Very courageously, therefore,
she turned a corner and began to thread her way
among the crowd.</p>

<p>She was laughing now. This thing was something
of a joke, after all. Still, she was rather
sorry it had happened&mdash;on Miss Jane's errand.
She would be late home, too. (She pulled aside the
lapel of her coat and glanced at her watch.) Five
o'clock, already! It would be late, indeed, if she
could not catch the five-fifteen! Still, there must
be other trains, of course, and it took only an hour
and twenty minutes to go&mdash;</p>

<p>Genevieve stopped with a little cry of dismay.
She remembered now that she had used the last of
the commutation tickets. Miss Jane had told her
to get a single-fare ticket for the return trip. And
now&mdash;pray, how was one to buy any sort of fare
without any money?</p>

<p>A hurrying man jostled <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads ' er'">her</ins>, and Genevieve
stepped into a doorway to <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'thin  '">think.</ins> Across the street
a blue-bell-sign caught her <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'at ention'">attention</ins>, and sent a
swift light to her eye.</p>


<p>Why, of course! She would telephone for Aunt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
Julia to send Nancy or somebody in with some
money. Why had she not thought of it before?</p>

<p>She had pushed her way half across the crowded
street when it occurred to her that she needed money
to pay the telephone toll.</p>

<p>"I never saw such a place! It takes money to
do everything! I just hate cities," she stormed
hotly&mdash;then jumped just in time to escape the
wheels of a swiftly-moving automobile.</p>

<p>Safely back in the doorway, she tried to think
once more. Then, slowly, she began to retrace her
steps toward the corner from which she had started.</p>

<p>The crowds were just as gay, the Christmas reds
and greens just as brilliant, and the tinsel stars and
crystal pendants were just as sparkling; but Genevieve
did not even look at them now. She was
tired, ashamed, and thoroughly frightened. The
bag, too, began to seem woefully full, and her
stomach correspondingly empty.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, after a time, the Christmas
service of the day before rang in her ears. It
seemed so far away now. And yet&mdash;it was only
yesterday that she had been promising herself never
again to be thoughtless, heedless, or impulsively
reckless of consequences. And now&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly she almost smiled. She was thinking
of her question to Harold:</p>

<p>"If you do something bad to do something good,
which is it, good or bad?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one the minutes passed. It grew darker
and colder. At times Genevieve walked on aimlessly.
At others, she stood one side, watching the
crowds, hoping to find some man or woman whom
she could dare to ask for money. But her cheeks
burned at the thought, and she never saw the man
or woman whom she wanted to ask&mdash;for money.
That the blue-coated man at the street-crossing
might help her, never occurred to Genevieve.
Genevieve knew policemen only as vaguely dreadful
creatures connected with jails and arrests.</p>

<p>In time it came to be quite dark. Genevieve wondered
what would become of her&mdash;by midnight.
People did not starve or die, she supposed, in Boston
streets&mdash;not when the streets were as bright
as these. But she <i>must</i> get to Sunbridge. <i>Sunbridge!</i>
How worried they must be about her now
in Sunbridge, and how she wished she were there!
She would be glad to see even Miss Jane's severest
frown&mdash;if she could see Miss Jane, too!</p>

<p>It was six o'clock when Genevieve suddenly remembered
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Butterfield. She
wondered then how it was possible that she had forgotten
them so long.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Butterfield were two
friends of Mrs. Kennedy's not very far from sixty
years old. They lived in a quaint old house on Mt.
Vernon Street, on top of Beacon Hill&mdash;Genevieve
thought she remembered the number. She remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the house very well, for she had called there
twice with Mrs. Kennedy the winter before.</p>

<p>It was with a glad little cry that Genevieve now
turned to the first woman she met and asked the
way to Mt. Vernon Street.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the somber Butterfield dining-room on Mt.
Vernon Street, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Butterfield
had almost finished dinner, when their pompous,
plainly scandalized butler, standing beneath the
severest of the severe Butterfield portraits, announced
stiffly:</p>

<p>"There's a young person at the door, ma'am,
with a bag. She says she knows you, if you'll see
her, please."</p>

<p>One minute later, the astonished Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Butterfield caught in their arms a white-faced,
almost fainting girl, who had sobbed out:</p>

<p>"Please, won't you give me a little money and
some supper, and telephone to Aunt Julia!"</p>

<p>Seven minutes later Mr. Thomas Butterfield had
Mrs. Kennedy at the other end of the wire.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>A BROWN DRESS FOR ELSIE</h3>


<p>Christmas, for Genevieve, was not a happy time
that year; and when the day was over she tried to
forget it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>She had stayed all night with the Butterfields&mdash;which
had not been unalloyed joy; for, though they
obviously tried to be kind to her, yet they could not
help showing that they regarded her sudden appearance
among them, dinnerless and moneyless, as
most extraordinary, and certainly very upsetting
to the equanimity of a well-ordered household.</p>

<p>In the morning she went back to Sunbridge. At
the house she found Miss Chick ill. Her cold, and
her fright over Genevieve, had sent her into a high
fever; and Mrs. Kennedy was scarcely less ill herself.</p>

<p>Certainly it was not exactly a cheerful Christmas
Day for the one whose heedlessness had brought it
all about. But Genevieve mourned so bitterly, and
blamed herself so strongly, that at last, out of sheer
pity, Mrs. Kennedy, and even Miss Jane Chick,
had to turn comforter; for&mdash;as Mrs. Kennedy reminded
her sister&mdash;it was, after all, aside from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
thoughtless lack of haste, only Genevieve's unselfish
forgetfulness of her own possible wants that led to
the whole thing. Then, and not until then, did
Genevieve bestow some attention upon her Christmas
presents, of which there were a generous number.</p>

<p>Fortunately no one outside the house had known
of Genevieve's nonappearance that Christmas Eve,
so she was spared any curious questions and interested
comments from others of the Happy Hexagons.</p>

<p>The short Christmas vacation sped rapidly. The
young people spent much of it on the river, skating,
when the ice was good. Genevieve, it is true, was
not often seen there. Genevieve was playing nurse
these days, and so devotedly attentive to Miss Jane
Chick was she, that both the ladies had almost to
scold her, in order to make her take needed exercise.
Even Harold Day reproached her one morning,
when he met her coming from the post-office.</p>

<p>"You don't let any of us see anything of you&mdash;not
anything," he complained. "And you look as
if you were doing penance, or something&mdash;you've
got such a superior expression!"</p>

<p>Genevieve dimpled into a sudden laugh.</p>

<p>"Maybe I am," she retorted. "Maybe I did
something bad so I could do something good; and
now I'm trying to do enough good to take out all
the taste of the bad."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what do you mean by that, Miss Mystery?"</p>

<p>She would not tell him. She only shook her head
saucily, and ran into the house.</p>

<p>By New Year's Day Miss Jane seemed almost
like her old self, and Genevieve was specially happy,
for on that night Harold Day gave the first dance
of the season; and, with Miss Jane better, and her
own heart lighter once more, she could give herself
up to full enjoyment of the music, fun,
and laughter.</p>

<p>All the Happy Hexagons were there, together
with O. B. J. Holmes, Charlie Brown, and many
other of the young people, including even Tilly
Mack's big brother, Howard, who&mdash;though quite
twenty-one&mdash;was a prime favorite with the Happy
Hexagons.</p>

<p>Genevieve was wonderfully happy that evening.
Never had the music sounded so entrancing; never
had her own feet felt so light. With Harold she
"opened the ball," as Tilly airily termed it; then
Charlie and O. B. J. had their turn.</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve, you do look just too sweet for
anything in that pale pink," panted Elsie, stopping
at her side between dances.</p>

<p>"Not any sweeter than you do in that white,"
tossed back Genevieve, affectionately.</p>

<p>Elsie sighed.</p>

<p>"I love this white, too, but it's got kind of frazzled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
now. Aunt Kate says she is going to make
over Fannie's brown silk for Miss Sally's wedding,"
she went on, sighing again.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that will be nice," rejoined Genevieve,
with hasty politeness.</p>

<p>"Y-yes," admitted Elsie; "only brown sounds
kind of hot for April. Still, I suppose I ought not
to mind. Just one girl wore it, anyhow, so it'll be
faded even, and I sha'n't look like two folks in it,"
she finished wistfully, as Howard Mack came up to
claim his dance with Genevieve.</p>

<p>It was three days after the party that there came
a letter from Mr. Jones in reply to Mrs. Kennedy's
Christmas note. It was a very grateful letter, but
it was a disappointing one. It said that Mr. Jones
did not see how he could let Quentina accept the
kind invitation of Mrs. Kennedy and Genevieve.
All the way through it, very plainly was shown the
longing of a man who desires advantages for his
daughter, and the pride of one who cannot bear
that outsiders should give them to her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy saw this&mdash;and wrote another letter.
In due time came the answer; and again Genevieve
almost cried with disappointment. But Mrs.
Kennedy smiled and comforted her.</p>

<p>"Yes, he says 'no,' I'll admit, Genevieve; but
I don't think it's quite so strong a 'no' as it was
before. One of these days I think I'll write Mr.
Jones another letter, my dear&mdash;but not just now.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
We'll let him think a little&mdash;of how good it would
have been for Quentina if he'd said 'yes.'"</p>

<p>Genevieve gave Mrs. Kennedy a big hug.</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia, you're a dear, and a veritable Solomon
for wisdom. I'm going to write at once to
the President, too. Your place is in the diplomatic
service, I'm sure," she finished, as she danced from
the room.</p>

<p>As January passed and February came, a new
subject came uppermost in the thoughts of the
Hexagon Club. For the first time in years there
was to be a prize contest in the Sunbridge High
School. The principal, Mr. Jackson, was to give a
five-dollar gold piece to the writer of the best essay,
subject to be chosen by the author.</p>

<p>"Well, I sha'n't try for it," announced Tilly on
a Saturday afternoon late in February, as the Hexagon
Club were holding their regular meeting at the
parsonage.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Because I don't like defeat well enough," retorted
Tilly. "Imagine <i>me</i> winning a prize contest!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall try," almost groaned Cordelia. "I
shall always try for things, I suppose, till I die. I
think I ought to; but of course I sha'n't win it.
Dear me! How I would love to, though," she cried,
almost under her breath.</p>

<p>Genevieve, looking at her momentarily illumined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
face, was conscious of a sudden fierce wish that Cordelia
might win that prize.</p>

<p>"Genevieve, of course, will try," she heard Tilly's
teasing voice say, then. "Genevieve loves to
write, so!"</p>

<p>Genevieve turned with a laugh, and an uptilted
chin.</p>

<p>"I take it, Miss Mack, that your very complimentary
remarks refer to my magazine notes; but
just let me assure you that this prize essay is quite
another matter. <i>That</i> isn't <i>printed!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then you <i>are</i> going to try?&mdash;of course you
are," interposed Bertha.</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed lightly as she reached for a
piece of fudge.</p>

<p>"I suppose so. I'm afraid everybody will expect
me to. Aunt Julia has already expressed her
opinion of the matter."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>February passed, and March came. A new topic
of conversation now arose, specially of interest to
the Hexagon Club. Miss Sally was to be married
early in April, and the Happy Hexagons were to be
bridesmaids. Naturally, even the new prize contest
had to step one side for that month, in the
minds of the six joyously excited girls.</p>

<p>It was on a particularly windy Saturday toward
the end of the month, that Cordelia literally blew
up to the Kennedys' front door and rang the bell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>Genevieve herself, passing through the hall,
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Br-r-r!" she laughed, as she banged the door
shut after admitting the whirling draperies from
which Cordelia's anxious little face finally emerged.
"Why, Cordelia!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; I'm going to be at the club this
afternoon, of course," panted Cordelia; "but this
is for something I wanted to say to you&mdash;and I
knew there wouldn't be a chance this afternoon.
It&mdash;it's private, Genevieve."</p>

<p>"Good! I love secrets. Come into the sitting
room. There's no one there this morning. Now,
what is it?" she demanded, as soon as Cordelia's
coat was off, and they were comfortably seated.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;I suppose you might call it missionary
work, Genevieve," smiled Cordelia, wistfully.</p>

<p>"<i>More</i> missionary work? Who in the world
wants to go to Texas now?" laughed Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Nobody. It isn't Texas at all. It's&mdash;Elsie."</p>

<p>"Elsie!"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, dear, I don't know as you can
do anything; but you've done so many things, and
I'm sure if you could, it <i>would</i> be missionary work
of the very nicest kind."</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> you talking about?"</p>

<p>Cordelia drew a long sigh.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you. You know the rest of us bridesmaids<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
are all going to wear white, but&mdash;but Elsie's
got to wear Fannie's brown silk."</p>

<p>"I know," nodded Genevieve. "Elsie told me."</p>

<p>"But, Genevieve, just think&mdash;brown silk for a
bridesmaid at a wedding, when all the rest of us
wear white! Besides, Elsie says brown is so hot-looking
for April. She feels awfully about it."</p>

<p>"Can't she do something? I should think she'd
tell her aunt."</p>

<p>"She has. But her aunt doesn't seem to understand.
She says that the brown silk is whole and
good, and far too valuable to throw away; and
that it's all just Elsie's notion that she'd rather
wear white."</p>

<p>"Oh, but if she'd only understand!"</p>

<p>"But that's just it&mdash;she doesn't understand.
And it isn't as if they were poor," argued Cordelia,
earnestly. "Now auntie has to make over things,
of course, for me and for Edith and Rachel, and we
expect it, and don't mind. We're all glad to be
economical and help out, for we know it's necessary.
But it's different with Elsie. She <i>says</i> she
wouldn't mind so, if they were poor and had to.
But the Gales are real well off&mdash;Fannie and the
twins have lots of new clothes. Poor Elsie says
sometimes it seems as if her aunt actually bought
things for them, so she <i>could</i> make them over for
her. Elsie says she's never so happy as when she's
doing it, and that she makes a regular game of it&mdash;cutting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
them out and putting them together&mdash;like
picture puzzles, you know."</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed, though she frowned, too.</p>

<p>"But what can I do?" she demanded. "I tried,
once, to&mdash;to lend Elsie a dress; but she was horrified."</p>

<p>"Mercy! Of course she was," shuddered Cordelia.
"I don't know <i>what</i> Mrs. Gale would do if
she knew that! They're fearfully&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;proud,
I suppose you call it," hesitated the conscientious
Cordelia.</p>

<p>"But what <i>can</i> I do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but don't you suppose you could&mdash;could
say something, somehow, to Mrs. Gale
that&mdash;that would make her understand?"</p>

<p>"Why, Cordelia Wilson, of course I couldn't,"
gasped Genevieve, indignantly. "A pretty picture
I'd make going to Mrs. Gale and saying: 'Madam,
why don't you give your niece a new dress when
you know she wants one?'"</p>

<p>"N-no, I suppose you couldn't do that, of course,"
sighed the other. "Very likely you couldn't do
anything, anyway. It's only that I thought&mdash;well,
I knew you were going home with Elsie after school
Monday night to study; and I didn't know but
you'd get a chance to say something. But I suppose,
after all, there won't be anything you could
say."</p>

<p>"No, I suppose there won't," echoed Genevieve,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
still plainly appalled at the task Cordelia had set
for her.</p>

<p>"Well, it's only that I was so sorry for Elsie,"
sighed Cordelia, as she rose to go.</p>

<p>"Of course! I reckon we're all sorry for Elsie,"
sighed Genevieve in her turn.</p>

<p>And she was sorry. All the rest of the morning
she kept thinking how very sorry she was; and
when afternoon came, and when she saw Elsie's lips
quiver and her eyes fill with tears, as the others
happily discussed whether they would wear colored
sashes or white belts with their white dresses, Genevieve's
heart quite overflowed with sympathy for
Elsie. And she wondered if, after all, it were possible
to make Elsie's aunt&mdash;understand. Determinedly,
then, she declared to herself that, regardless
of consequences, she would try&mdash;if she had the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Genevieve's opportunity came very soon after
she arrived at Elsie's home Monday afternoon.
Even Genevieve herself had to admit that she could
not have had a better one. But so frightened was
she that she wished&mdash;for a moment&mdash;that there
were none. Then before her rose a vision of Elsie's
tear-dimmed eyes and quivering lips&mdash;and with a
quick-drawn breath Genevieve rose and followed
Mrs. Gale to the sewing-room.</p>

<p>"Come with me," Mrs. Gale had said to Genevieve&mdash;Genevieve
had picked up a scrap of brown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
silk from the floor. "That's a piece of the dress
I'm making for Elsie to wear to the wedding. The
silly child has got a notion she wants white, but
you'll think this is pretty, I'm sure." And it was
then that Genevieve knew her opportunity had
come.</p>

<p>In the sewing-room Mrs. Gale proudly spread
the silk dress over a chair-back.</p>

<p>"There! What do you think of that?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Genevieve's heart beat so loudly she thought Mrs.
Gale must hear it.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;it's very pretty, isn't it?" she stammered,
wetting her dry lips and wondering what good it
did to say that.</p>

<p>"Pretty? Of course it is. It's silk, and a fine
piece&mdash;I thought when I got it how splendidly it
would make over. I'm sure any girl ought to be
proud to wear it!"</p>

<p>Genevieve caught her breath sharply. "Proud"&mdash;Mrs.
Gale had said "proud"; and Cordelia had
said, that morning, that Mrs. Gale herself was very
proud, and that she would be very angry if she
knew that Genevieve had offered Elsie a dress to
wear. In a flash of inspiration, then, came a wild
plan to Genevieve's mind. If only she had the audacity
to carry it out!</p>

<p>She wet her lips again, and took desperate hold
of her courage. Even as she did so, she almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
smiled&mdash;she was thinking: was this another case
when she was doing something bad to do something
good? Never mind; she must go through with it
now. She <i>must!</i></p>

<p>"Yes, it is a very pretty dress, indeed," she stammered;
"and it was Fannie's, too, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gale beamed.</p>

<p>"Yes!&mdash;and didn't I get it out finely? You
know sleeves are smaller, so that helped, and the
breadths were so full last year! I think I never
got a dress out better," she finished proudly.</p>

<p>Genevieve touched the folds lightly.</p>

<p>"And this isn't faded at all, is it?" she murmured
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"What?" Mrs. Gale's voice was a little sharp.</p>

<p>Genevieve wet her lips twice this time before she
could speak.</p>

<p>"I say, isn't it nice that this one isn't faded?
You know Elsie had such a time with that chambray
last summer!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean, please?" There was no
doubt now about the sharpness in Mrs. Gale's
voice.</p>

<p>Genevieve managed a laugh&mdash;but it was not a
very mirthful one.</p>

<p>"Why, 'twas so funny, you know; it was made
from the twins' dresses, and they weren't faded
alike. It was just as Elsie said&mdash;she didn't know
whether to turn Cora or Clara toward folks. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
<i>was</i> funny; only, of course it did plague poor Elsie
awfully, and I felt so sorry for her."</p>

<p>"You felt sorry&mdash;<i>sorry</i> for <i>my niece?</i>" The
voice was so very angry this time that Genevieve
trembled. She was sure now that it was bad&mdash;this
thing she was doing&mdash;that good might come. But
she kept bravely on.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course; all of us girls were sorry
for her. You know Elsie does so love new dresses,
and of course she doesn't have them very often.
Last summer, when she was feeling so bad over her
chambray, I&mdash;I offered her one of mine, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you offered my niece one of <i>your</i>
dresses?" gasped Mrs. Gale.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she wouldn't take it; and, of course,
<i>that</i> wasn't <i>new</i>, either," finished Genevieve, with
what she hoped would pass for a light laugh as she
turned away.</p>

<p>Behind her, for a moment, there was an ominous
silence. Then a very quiet voice said:</p>

<p>"Thank you; but I hardly think my niece needs
one of your dresses&mdash;yet, Miss Genevieve."</p>

<p>Genevieve fled then, ashamed, and very near to
crying.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't have said it, of course," she whispered
to herself as she stumbled back to the sitting-room;
"I wouldn't have said it if the Gales had
been poor and <i>couldn't</i> have given Elsie new things
to wear once in a while!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Chronicles of the Hexagon Club a fortnight
later, it was Elsie Martin who wrote the account
of Miss Sally's wedding. She wrote as follows:</p>

<p>"I had a beautiful white dress for Miss Sally's
wedding&mdash;a brand-new one. All of us girls wore
white and looked so pretty&mdash;I mean, the rest
looked pretty, of course. Miss Sally was married
the tenth of April. It was quite a warm day, and I
was so glad I did not have to wear my brown silk.
Aunt Kate says I needn't wear it anywhere if I
don't want to&mdash;and after all her work, too! I
don't know what has got into Aunt Kate, anyway,
lately. She doesn't seem half so interested in
making over things, and I have three other brand-new
dresses, a pink-sprigged muslin, and&mdash;but,
dear me! This isn't telling about Miss Sally's wedding
one bit.</p>

<p>"She was married at four o'clock, and looked too
sweet for anything in light gray silk with a pink
carnation in her hair. Everybody went, and wore
their best things and looked very nice. We had
sandwiches and chicken salad and olives and three
kinds of cake and ice cream for refreshments. The
ice cream was the brick kind, different colors, like
lovely striped ribbon.</p>

<p>"At six o'clock they started for Boston to begin
their journey West, and we all stood on the steps
and gave them a lovely send-off with rice and old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
shoes. Just at the last minute Tilly says, 'Let's
give her our Texas yell, and end with "Miss Sally,"'
and we did. And everybody laughed and clapped.
But not until the carriage drove off did we suddenly
remember that she wasn't 'Miss Sally' at all any
more, and we felt ashamed.</p>

<p>"And that's all&mdash;except that Miss Sally's going-away
gown was gray, too."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>"WHEN SUNBRIDGE WENT TO TEXAS"</h3>


<p>By the first of May many of the papers for the
new prize contest had been turned in. Genevieve's,
however, had not. Genevieve was working very
hard on her essay now. For some time she had not
found a subject that suited her. Good subjects were
not very plentiful, she decided. At last she had
thought of the Texas trip, and had wondered if she
could not compare Sunbridge with Texas. Aunt
Julia and Miss Jane had thought decidedly that she
could. So for some days now, she had been hard at
work upon the paper, and was getting enthusiastically
interested.</p>

<p>All papers must be in by the sixteenth. It was
on the tenth that Cordelia, during a recess meeting
of the Hexagon Club, drew a long breath and
turned upon her fellow members a beaming countenance.</p>

<p>"Girls, I can't keep it a minute longer. I've got
to tell you!"</p>

<p>"Tell us what?" asked Tilly. "It must be something
pretty fine to bring that look to your face!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Cordelia laughed and blushed; but she sighed,
too.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't 'fine,' Tilly, at all. I wish it were,
though&mdash;but really, I do think it's the best thing
I ever did, anyway."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about, Cordelia Wilson?"
demanded Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Mercy! It must be pretty good if it's the <i>best</i>
thing Cordelia ever did," teased Bertha.</p>

<p>"Girls, stop," begged Cordelia, in real distress.
"I&mdash;I hate to tell you now; it sounds so foolish.
It's only&mdash;my prize paper. It's all done. I'm going
to hand it in Monday, and&mdash;and I was so
pleased with the subject!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Cordelia, what is it? You know what mine
is," cried Elsie.</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;'When Sunbridge went to Texas,'" announced
Cordelia, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"When&mdash;what?" cried Genevieve, almost
sharply.</p>

<p>Cordelia turned a happy face.</p>

<p>"I knew <i>you'd</i> like it, Genevieve," she nodded.
"It's our trip, you know. I've told all about it&mdash;comparing
things here to things there, you see."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;but, Cordelia, that's&mdash;" Genevieve
paused abruptly. The pause in her sentence was
not noticed. The girls were all talking now, begging
Cordelia to tell them if they were "in it."</p>

<p>"When&mdash;when did you choose your subject,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Cordelia?" asked Genevieve, very quietly, when she
could be heard.</p>

<p>"Not until the first of May. I just couldn't
seem to get anything. Then this came all of a sudden,
and&mdash;and it just seemed to write itself, it was
done so quickly. You see I didn't have to look up
this subject."</p>

<p>Genevieve's face cleared. It was all right, after
all. <i>She</i> had selected the subject a whole week before
Cordelia&mdash;and of course Cordelia would
understand.</p>

<p>"Oh, but Cordelia, that isn't quite fair," she
began impulsively; but for once Cordelia forgot
her politeness and interrupted.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Genevieve," she laughed
gayly. "I've said lovely things of Texas. You'd
know I'd do that, Genevieve, even if I do love
Sunbridge. I did worry at first for fear somebody
else had taken the same subject&mdash;some of you
girls&mdash;you know we can't have two about the
same thing."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" The bell rang for the close of recess,
and again one of Genevieve's sentences remained
unfinished.</p>

<p>Genevieve did not stop even to speak to any of
the girls after school that day. She went home at
once. Even Harold Day, who overtook her, found
her so absorbed in her own thoughts that she was
anything but her usual talkative self.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>Once in the house, Genevieve went straight to
Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia, if you get a prize subject first, it's
yours, isn't it?" she asked tremulously.</p>

<p>"Why, y-yes, dear; I should think so."</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Julia, something perfectly awful
has happened. Cordelia has got my subject."</p>

<p>"Oh, Genevieve, I'm so sorry!" Mrs. Kennedy's
face showed more than ordinary distress&mdash;Mrs.
Kennedy had had high hopes of this prize
paper. "Why, how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I suppose it was just in the air.
But <i>I</i> got it first. She says she didn't think of it
till May first. So of course it's&mdash;it's mine, Aunt
Julia."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy looked very grave.</p>

<p>"I think the rules of the contest would give it
to you, Genevieve," she said.</p>

<p>The girl stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm awfully sorry. She&mdash;she was
going to hand it in Monday."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is too bad!"</p>

<p>There was a long silence.</p>

<p>"I suppose I&mdash;I'll have to tell her," murmured
Genevieve, at last. "The club have a ride to-morrow.
There'll be time&mdash;then."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if you decide to do it."</p>

<p>Genevieve turned quickly.</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Julia, I'll have to," she cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
"Just think of all my work! Mine's all done but
copying, you know. And I <i>was</i> the first to get it.
There's no time to get another now."</p>

<p>"No, there's no time to get another&mdash;now."
Aunt Julia looked even more sorrowful than Genevieve
just then&mdash;Aunt Julia <i>had</i> wanted Genevieve
to take that prize.</p>

<p>"I'm sure that Cordelia&mdash;when she knows&mdash;"
Genevieve did not finish her sentence.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! Of course, if Cordelia should
know&mdash;" Aunt Julia did not finish <i>her</i> sentence.</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Julia, she'll have to know," almost
sobbed Genevieve.</p>

<p>There was a long silence. Genevieve's eyes were
out the window. Mrs. Kennedy, watching her, suddenly
spoke up with careless briskness:</p>

<p>"Of course you'll tell Cordelia that 'twas <i>your</i>
subject, that <i>you</i> got it first, and that <i>you</i> want it.
Very likely she won't care much, anyway."</p>

<p>"Why, Aunt Julia, she will! If you could have
seen her face when she talked of it&mdash;" Genevieve
stopped abruptly. Genevieve <i>did</i> suddenly see Cordelia's
face as it had been that afternoon, all aglow
with happiness. She heard her eager voice say,
too: "I think it's the best thing I ever did!"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, but maybe she doesn't care for the
prize," observed Mrs. Kennedy, still carelessly.</p>

<p>"But, Aunt Julia, she does; she&mdash;" Again
Genevieve stopped abruptly. She was remembering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
now how Cordelia's face had looked that February
afternoon at the parsonage when she had said:
"Of course I sha'n't win it&mdash;dear me, how I would
love to, though!"</p>

<p>"But she'll understand, of course, when you tell
her it's <i>your</i> subject and that <i>you</i> want it," went on
Mrs. Kennedy, smoothly. Genevieve did not see
the keen, almost fearful glances, that Mrs. Kennedy
was giving her between the light words.</p>

<p>"I know; but that sounds so&mdash;so&mdash;" There
was a long pause; then Genevieve, with a quivering
sigh, rose slowly and left the room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy, for some unapparent reason,
smiled&mdash;but there were tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>The Hexagon Club took a long ride the next
day. Five of them talked again of Cordelia's paper,
and four begged Cordelia to tell what she had said
about them. If Genevieve, alone, was unusually
silent, nobody, apparently, noticed it. They were
riding by themselves to-day. They had invited
none of the boys or other girls to join them.</p>

<p>It was when the ride was over, and when Genevieve
had almost reached the Kennedy driveway,
that she said wistfully, stroking the mare's
neck:</p>

<p>"Topsy, I just couldn't. I just couldn't! It
sounded so&mdash;so&mdash;And, Topsy, <i>you</i> couldn't, if
you'd seen how awfully happy she looked!"</p>

<p>"What did Cordelia say?" asked Mrs. Kennedy,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
when Genevieve came into the house a little
later. There was no hint in the lady's voice of the
hope that was in her heart.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I didn't tell her, Aunt Julia," stammered
Genevieve. Then, with a playful whimsicality that
did not in the least deceive Aunt Julia's ears, she
added: "Who wants that old prize, anyhow?"</p>

<p>It was a beautiful smile, then, that illumined
Aunt Julia's face, and it was a very tender kiss that
fell on Genevieve's forehead.</p>

<p>"That's my brave Genevieve&mdash;and I'm sure
you'll never regret it, my dear!" she said.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>May passed, and June came, bringing warm,
sunny days that were very tempting to feet that
were longing to be tramping through green woods
and fields. Examinations, however, were coming
soon, and Genevieve knew that, tempting as was
the beautiful out-of-doors, studies must come first.
Every possible minute, however, she spent in rides,
walks, and tennis playing&mdash;even Miss Jane insisted
that she must have exercise.</p>

<p>June brought not only alluring days, however,
but a letter from Quentina, which sent Genevieve
flying into Mrs. Kennedy's room.</p>

<p>"Aunt Julia, did you write again to Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"I did," smiled Mrs. Kennedy, "and I have a
letter from him to-day."</p>

<p>"You darling! Then you know, of course! Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
Aunt Julia, isn't it lovely! I just can't wait till to-morrow
to tell the girls."</p>

<p>Genevieve did wait, however&mdash;she waited even
till the morning recess. She wanted all the Happy
Hexagons together; and when she had them together
she told them the astounding news in one
breathless rush of words.</p>

<p>"Girls, Quentina's coming next year to school.
She's going to room with me. Isn't it lovely!"</p>

<p>There was a chorus of delighted questions
and exclamations; but Genevieve lifted her
hand.</p>

<p>"Sh-h! Listen. I've got her letter here. You
must hear it!" and she whipped open the letter
and began to read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;It isn't true&mdash;it can't be true!
But father says it is, and father doesn't lie. I'm
to go to Sunbridge. Sunbridge! I think Sunbridge
is the loveliest name in the world&mdash;for a
town, I mean, of course.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Genevieve</span>:&mdash;There! this is actually
the first minute I could bring myself to begin this
letter properly. Really, a thing like this can't just
begin, you know! And to think that I'm going to
see Paul Revere's grave and Bunker Hill and you
just next September! Oh, how can I ever thank
you and dear Mrs. Kennedy? I love her, love her,
love her&mdash;right now! And all the Happy Hexagons&mdash;I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
love them, too. I love everybody and
everything&mdash;I'm going to Sunbridge!</p>

<p>"All day I've been saying over and over to myself
that song in the 'Lady of the Lake,' only I've
changed the words a little to fit my case; like this:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'Quentina, rest! thy longing o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Sleep the sleep that knows no breaking;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:0.5em;">Dream of Texas schools no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Days of longing, nights of sighing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left:0.5em;">For Paul Revere's enchanted land.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Hands unseen thy days are planning,</span><br />

</div>

<p>"That 'more' is poetry, but a fib; for of course
I haven't been East at all yet. But that's just poetic
license, you know&mdash;fibs like that.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just can't wait for September!</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your happy, happy</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Quentina</span>."<br />
</div></div>

<p>"My, but won't she be a picnic when she gets
here?" chuckled Tilly, as soon as she could stop
laughing long enough to find her voice.</p>

<p>"What in the world is the matter with you
girls?" demanded Charlie Brown, sauntering up to
them, arm in arm with O. B. J. Holmes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Tilly turned merrily.</p>

<p>"Matter! I guess you'll think something is the
matter when Quentina Jones gets here," she laughed.</p>

<p>"Who is Quentina Jones?"</p>

<p>"She is a new girl who is coming to school next
year," explained Elsie.</p>

<p>"She's from Texas, and she's never been East
before," chimed in Bertha.</p>

<p>"Yes, and as for you, Mr. Obejay Holmes,"
teased Tilly, "just you wait! There's no telling
what she will do with your name!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>O. B. J. spoke to Tilly, but he threw a merry
glance into Genevieve's understanding eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing, only she's a regular walking rhyming
dictionary, and I can just fancy how those mysterious
initials of yours will fire her up. My poor little
'O Be Joyful' won't be in it, then. You'll see!"</p>

<p>"I don't worry any," laughed O. B. J. Holmes,
with another merry glance at Genevieve.</p>

<p>"You don't have to," interposed Genevieve,
promptly. "Quentina is everything that is sweet
and lovely, and you'll all like her; I know you will,"
she finished, as the bell rang and the boys turned
laughingly away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>A GOOD-BY PARTY</h3>


<p>The June days sped so rapidly that Genevieve
wondered where they went, sometimes. School was
to close the twenty-third. Mr. Hartley was to arrive
on the twentieth. Meanwhile examinations and
the prize contest were uppermost in every one's
thoughts. Graduation exercises were to come in
the evening. The winner of the prize was to be
announced at that time, also.</p>

<p>"And really, you know, the announcement of
the prize-winner is all we care about specially,"
Elsie said one day, in the presence of a group of
her friends on the schoolhouse steps.</p>

<p>"Just you wait till you graduate," laughed back
Bertha's brother, Charlie, "and then I guess the
<i>evening</i> exercises will be of some consequence."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;but that won't be till two years
from now," cried Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Then you girls will be thinking more of frills
and furbelows than you will of prizes," laughed
Harold Day.</p>

<p>"I've got a new white dress for Graduation
night," said Elsie in a low voice to Genevieve, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
I don't believe I could have a prettier one, even
then."</p>

<p>"Another new white dress?" demanded Tilly,
who had heard the aside. "Why, Elsie Martin, you
had one for Miss Sally's wedding!"</p>

<p>Elsie laughed happily.</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;but this is a muslin. Aunt Kate
seemed to want me to have it&mdash;and of course I'd
love to have it, myself!"</p>

<p>Genevieve, for some reason, looked suddenly
very happy, so much so that Harold, watching her,
said quietly a minute later:</p>

<p>"Well, young lady, what's gone specially right
with your world to-day?"</p>

<p>Genevieve laughed and blushed. She shook her
head roguishly. Then suddenly she rejoined:</p>

<p>"I reckon one of my awfully bad things has
turned out all good&mdash;that's all!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>True to his word, Mr. Hartley came on the
twentieth. He was to be Mrs. Kennedy's guest
until the start for Texas after school had closed.</p>

<p>"My, dearie! how fine and tall we are growing,"
he greeted his daughter affectionately. "Looks like
Mr. Tim and the boys won't know you, I'm thinking!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Of course they will&mdash;and I
can't hardly wait to see them, either," cried Genevieve.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>It is doubtful if, on Graduation night, Cordelia
Wilson herself listened to the announcement of the
prize-winner any more anxiously than did Genevieve.
It seemed as if she could not bear it&mdash;after
what had happened&mdash;if Cordelia did not get the
prize. And Cordelia got it.</p>

<p>"'When Sunbridge went to Texas,'" read Mr.
Jackson, "Cordelia Wilson." And it was Genevieve
who clapped the loudest.</p>

<p>Cordelia, certainly, was beatifically happy. And
when Genevieve saw her amazed, but joyously happy
face, she wondered why she should suddenly want
to cry&mdash;for, surely, she had never felt happier in
her life.</p>

<p>Graduation day, for the Happy Hexagons, was
not, after all, quite the last meeting together; for
Mrs. Kennedy gave Genevieve a porch party the
night before she was to start back to Texas with
Mr. Hartley.</p>

<p>A very merry crowd of boys and girls it was that
sang college songs and told stories that night on
the Kennedys' roomy, electric-lighted veranda.</p>

<p>"It seems just as if I couldn't have you go away,"
sighed Cordelia, at last, to Genevieve.</p>

<p>"But I'm coming back next year."</p>

<p>"Mercy! We couldn't stand it if you weren't,"
cried Tilly.</p>

<p>"And just think&mdash;last year we all went back
with you," murmured Elsie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you were going this year," declared
Genevieve.</p>

<p>"I guess you aren't the only one that wishes
that," cut in several longing voices.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll take you all now&mdash;if you'll go,"
retorted Genevieve, merrily.</p>

<p>"<i>All</i>&mdash;did you say?" challenged Harold Day.</p>

<p>"Yes, all," nodded Genevieve, emphatically.
"We'd be glad to have you, every one of you."</p>

<p>"Well, I begin to think you would&mdash;now that
I've seen Texas," sighed Tilly. "But I suppose we
shall have to content ourselves till you come back
this time."</p>

<p>"And this wonderful little rhyming dictionary, as
Miss Tilly calls her&mdash;does she come back with
you?" asked O. B. J. Holmes.</p>

<p>"Maybe. She comes next fall, anyway, before
school begins," smiled Genevieve.</p>

<p>"Well, what I want to know is, if you are going
to do any more Texas missionary work," suggested
Charlie Brown.</p>

<p>"Pooh! She doesn't do that there&mdash;she does
that here," cut in Tilly.</p>

<p>"There isn't any more to do, anyway," declared
the exact Cordelia, happily. "She's got everything
fixed even down to Elsie's&mdash;" She stopped just
in time, but already Genevieve had interposed hurriedly:</p>

<p>"Oh, but it wasn't I that did anything. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
Cordelia. She found them to begin with, you know&mdash;Reddy,
and Hermit Joe's son."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kennedy and Miss Jane, together with
Nancy appeared just then with great plates of ice
cream and delicious cake; and after that, all too
soon, came the time for good-nights. The good-nights
were not quite finished, however, until at the
foot of the walk, five members of the Hexagon Club
turned, and all together gave their Texas yell with
a lusty "Genevieve" at the end that brought the
tears to the real Genevieve's eyes.</p>

<p>"Mercy! What will the neighbors say&mdash;at this
time of night!" protested Miss Jane Chick, feebly;
but her eyes, too, were moist.</p>
